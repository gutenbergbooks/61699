<h2 id="FOREWORD">FOREWORD</h2>

<p class="dropcap">My reader. Perhaps you have had the
good fortune to visit Egypt! If such
be the case, you have undoubtedly stood
among the giant columns of the Temple to the
Sun-god Amen in the Northern Apt (Karnak).
You have marveled at the ever changing colors
which light up the walls and columns of the
Temple of the Southern Apt (Luxor), so that
at one moment they seem to have been carved
from blocks of amber, at another from coral,
jasper, amethyst or, as the last bright rays of
the sinking sun fall full upon them, from colossal
bars of red Nubian gold.</p>

<p>You have gazed in awe and reverence at the
mummy of King Amenhotep, lying in his granite
sarcophagus, peacefully asleep he seemed, deep
down in the very heart of the Theban Hills.</p>

<p>In an alcove nearby you may recall the three
bodies lying, uncoffined, upon the bare rock of
the tomb chamber. You were informed that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
bodies had been removed from their own tombs
to this secret chamber of a dead Pharaoh, that
they might be saved from the hands of tomb-robbers.</p>

<p>“The mummies of unknown royal personages,”
your Arab guide informed you.</p>

<p>Perhaps the guide permitted you to touch the
long black tresses of one of the three. He
pointed out what he called the mark of an arrow,
which caused the death of another. He told you
that the boy had undoubtedly met his death at
the hands of a strangler. He hinted at foul
murder!</p>

<p>If what he said of the three was true, he
might well have attempted to identify the
bodies. They are, perhaps, those of Wazmes,
Queen Hanit’s murdered son, the beautiful
slave girl Bhanar, and her one-time mistress,
the Princess Sesen, whose wavy black hair appears
as soft to-day as when Ramses and Menna
wooed her, as when Renny the Syrian died for
her.</p>

<p>All this, and more, you have doubtless seen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span></p>

<p>Yet, it is safe to say, you have never so much
as heard of the mystery surrounding the tomb
of Menna, son of Menna, that most baffling
among the many mysterious tombs in and about
the great Theban cemeteries.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly, Menna, son of Menna, had in
life an enemy, a most vindictive enemy; one
whose malignant hatred followed Menna into
his very tomb.</p>

<p>Enter that tomb to-day, and you see at a
glance that this enemy sought to nullify and
make ineffectual the entire series of engraved
prayers and magic formulæ which witness to
Menna’s hopes for an eternity of bliss upon the
banks of the Celestial Nile. Yes, Menna’s implacable
foe sought to destroy him, both body
and soul!</p>

<p>Menna’s body was not found when, recently,
his tomb was discovered and opened. We may
thus infer that Menna’s arch-enemy accomplished
the destruction of Menna’s body as successfully,
as fiendishly we may suppose, as he
did that of Menna’s soul.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span></p>

<p>Examine the sculptures upon the walls of his
tomb. You will find that Menna’s eyes have
been cut out; that the lips of his servants and
field hands are missing; that the tips of his
hunting arrows have been blunted; that the
knots in his “measuring-rope” have been destroyed.
Yet, worse than all, the plumb of the
scales, upon which Menna’s heart will be
weighed at the Judgment, has vanished.</p>

<p>Let us suppose that Menna’s mummy <em>had</em>
been found, found intact; at the opening of
his tomb. That empty shell would have
been of little use to Menna. Since, following
his enemy’s work of desecration upon the
ordered prayers, incantations and scenes
painted or engraved upon the walls of his tomb,
Menna’s body was doomed to inevitable destruction,
and with it, that of his <i>ka</i> or
“double,” that other self which, from the day
of his birth, awaited him in the heavens.</p>

<p>Without eyes Menna could not find his way
among the flint-strewn valleys and precipitous
heights of the Underworld. Without arrows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
Menna would be unable to obtain food. Menna’s
servants had all perished, as without mouths
they could neither eat nor drink. And Menna
might never measure off an allotted acreage
among the ever fertile fields of Heaven if, in
spite of all, he somehow managed to win
through to the Celestial Nile.</p>

<p>Alas! this success Menna could never hope to
achieve. The breaking of the plumb of the
scales rendered it impossible that Menna’s
trembling soul could pass Osiris, Judge of the
Dead, or the fierce hound Amemet, which, with
open mouth, awaited his victims beside that
great god’s throne.</p>

<p>No! Menna could never hope to feast at the
Table of the Gods. Menna could never enjoy
that eternity of bliss among the Blessed Fields
of Aaru which a beneficent Sun-god had promised
to the faithful.</p>

<p>But, Menna’s body was <em>not</em> found at the time
of the discovery of his tomb, though his body
had evidently been placed in the white sarcophagus
prepared for it by royal command.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span></p>

<p>Who so bitterly hated Menna, the King’s
Overseer? Who so relentlessly sought not alone
the destruction of his mortal body but the very
annihilation of his soul?</p>

<h1>HANIT THE ENCHANTRESS</h1>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I<br />
<span class="smcap smaller">Tells of How Professor Ranney Purchased an Ancient Manuscript
and of What He Found Therein.</span></h2>

<p class="dropcap">The shop of Tanos the Greek, “Dealer in
Genuine Antiques,” as the sign above the
door advised, might well have been
named a museum of ancient art and curiosities.
Entered from the front of the Sharia Kamel,
one of the main thoroughfares of Cairo, the shop
appeared at first glance to consist of but two
long narrow rooms, the one immediately behind
the other. Both rooms were filled to the very
ceiling with curios of all sorts, from little agate
beads to vast and shapeless mummies of Sacred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
Bulls. A half dozen bodies of Egyptian priests,
unwrapped and black with natron, stood
propped against the walls of the upper room.
The odor of cinnamon, myrrh and other embalming
essences filled the rooms and drifted
out through the open door to blend with the
indefinable, but never forgettable, odor of the
Cairene streets.</p>

<p>A nearer view of the upper room disclosed
the approach to what Tanos called the “holy of
holies.” This third, or innermost chamber, was
screened from the eyes of the ordinary souvenir
hunter by an ivory-inlaid door of ancient Coptic
woodwork.</p>

<p>Connoisseurs generally knew that here were
kept the treasures <i lang="fr">par excellence</i>. Here Tanos
would display rare statuettes, bronzes, ivories
and richly glazed potteries for the archæologist;
inscriptions on stone or papyrus for the
philologist; diadems or pendants in the precious
metals, necklaces, bracelets and bangles of varicolored
gems,—all such rich treasure from the
seemingly inexhaustible storehouse of antiquity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
as would be most likely to tempt the antiquarian,
or dazzle the mere man of millions seeking
to enrich his curio cabinet or the shelves of his
pet museum or institution.</p>

<p>During the course of an unusually hot afternoon
in late March three Europeans paused at
the threshold of Tanos’ shop.</p>

<p>Following their exit from the Ezbekiyeh Gardens
their footsteps had been dogged by that
genial soul, Ali Nubi, whose efforts to dispose
of fly-whisks and sunshades were in no wise
affected by the temperature. He was soon
joined by a troupe of exceedingly dirty Arab
children. These turned handsprings along the
gutter in hopes of some small coin with which
to buy <i>loukum</i>.</p>

<p>Finally, the nerves of the three Europeans
had been set on edge by the insistent whine of
a deformed Egyptian, whose ceaseless cry for
dole, “<i>baksheesh, baksheesh, ya khawageh</i>,”
finally caused one of the trio to turn upon him
with an impatient, <i>Allah yalik, kelb ibn kelb</i>.
This, in plain English, might be rendered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
“May God give to thee, dog, son of a dog,” at
once a pious wish and a curse.</p>

<p>The sound of the guttural Arabic sufficed to
scatter at one and the same instant all three
disturbing elements.</p>

<p>The ragged boys fled. Ali Nubi sauntered off
to display his merchandise and his famous smile
elsewhere, whilst the cripple, with a frightened
glance up and down the street, made off as fast
as his deformities would allow. The white man
was doubtless a <i>pasha</i>, a <i>bey</i>. Abut Talib felt
the sting of the bastinado upon his withered
limbs!</p>

<p>With a laugh the “bey” turned to his companions:</p>

<p>“Enter, Mrs. Gardiner! After you, Clem! I
want you to see my latest find.”</p>

<p>Professor Ranney followed his companions
into the shop. In answer to his call Tanos himself
appeared at the door of the sanctum. His
face lit up with a smile of genuine pleasure
when he recognized his visitors.</p>

<p>He crossed the room with that peculiar crooking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
of the spine which appears to be an ineradicable
heritage of the ages to Levantines of his
stamp wherever met. How well did the Egyptian
sculptor of the late New Empire catch that
deferential abasement of self!</p>

<p>Professor Ranney shook hands with Tanos.
Gardiner, too, greeted him, and introduced the
lady of the trio as his bride. For an instant
Tanos searched his fertile brains for a suitable
congratulatory quotation from the Arabian
classics. Oriental etiquette demanded that he
rise to the emergency. Finally, bending over
Mrs. Gardiner’s hand, Tanos murmured those
charming lines from Abu Selim’s poem on the
love of Omar and Leila.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Tanos! What exquisite verses.
What a wonderful gift of improvisation!”</p>

<p>Tanos bowed again. He made a deprecatory
gesture, murmuring as he did so something
about the meter of the second line.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gardiner shot a covert glance in the
direction of her husband.</p>

<p>The minx, thought he. He well knew that she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
had recognized the true authorship of the
verses. Mrs. Gardiner had been a former student
of her husband at the University of London,
where he taught Semitics.</p>

<p>These small social amenities attended to,
Tanos ushered his visitors into the innermost
room. In another moment all four were seated
about a low Turkish table. Upon this reposed
two objects, a turquoise-blue goblet of ancient
Egyptian pottery and a linen roll, seemingly of
great antiquity, if one might judge by its condition.</p>

<p>Meeting the Gardiners in the tea-house of the
Gardens, Professor Ranney had urged them to
walk over to the shop, in order that they might
see the contents of this linen roll, a papyrus
scroll of greatest importance, not alone on its
own account, but, more especially, for the remarkable
document which it contained.</p>

<p>Professor Ranney carefully unrolled the frail,
discolored linen in which, three thousand years
before, the scroll had been wrapped. At once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
the air was filled with a strange, aromatic perfume.</p>

<p>At sight of the brightly painted vignettes
which ornamented each and every page of the
closely written sheets, Mrs. Gardiner burst into
repeated exclamations of rapture. Even Dr. Gardiner,
her husband, who may be said to have
lived in an atmosphere charged with the odor
of ancient parchments, could not repress his
interest.</p>

<p>This interest was intensified when he read, on
the front page of the manuscript, the names of
an ancient Egyptian monarch “<i>Nibmara Amenhotep,
King of Upper and Lower Egypt, Triumphant</i>.”</p>

<p>“This is indeed a treasure, Steven! A perfect
copy of the Book of the Dead. You did well to
purchase it before I got wind of it. By Jove!
It is in better condition than the Papyrus of Ani
in the British Museum!”</p>

<p>Without replying Steven Ranney turned to
the last two pages of the scroll. Inserted between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
them was a brown stained sheet of hieroglyphics
written in red ink.</p>

<p>“Read this, Clem. To me it appears to be a
find of far more importance than the Ritual
itself.”</p>

<p>Gardiner translated aloud the lines of somewhat
tremblingly written hieroglyphics:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>A Contract which the Hereditary Prince,
the Count, Sole Companion of the King, Instructor
of the Royal Princess, and Chief Royal
Architect, Amenhotep, son of Hap, made with
Hotepra, Great High Priest of Amen.</i></p>

<p>“<i>It is ordained that there be given to the
statue of Amenhotep which is in his tomb on the
western shore, 1,000 loaves of bread, 1,000 fatted
geese, 1,000 jars of wine and 100 bulls, upon
the 1st day of the 1st month of the year, what
time the servants bring presents to their lord,
and lights are lit in house, in tomb and in temple!</i></p>

<p>“<i>In payment of this endowment of his tomb,
Amenhotep, son of Hap, engages to reveal to
Hotepa, Great High Priest of Amen, the secret<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
hiding-place of the Luminous Book of Thoth,
Scribe of the Gods!</i></p>

<p>“<i>Behold! Amenhotep, son of Hap, he saith:
‘By the magic incantation contained within this
book the Gods are compelled! By its hekau-charms
the Boat of the Sun is stopped, the Moon
is darkened!</i></p>

<p>“<i>Lo, he that reciteth the formulæ contained
therein, may descend into the Underworld and
return to mingle again with mortal men.</i></p>

<p>“<i>Lo, the possessor of this Book becomes as
the Scribe of the Gods, Thoth himself! For Ra
hath breathed upon it; Shu hath entered it!</i></p>

<p>“<i>Saith Amenhotep, son of Hap: ‘Behold, as
Ra the Sun-god liveth, the Magic Book may be
found in a box behind the wall of the false door
built within the western end of my tomb chamber!’</i></p>

<p>“<i>Now, Hotepra heard the oath of Amenhotep
and the saying which he said.</i></p>

<p>“<i>Lo, Hotepra, Great High Priest of Amen,
believed the words of the son of Hapi.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>“<i>Hotepra, Great High Priest of Amen, signed
the contract, taking the Great Gods, Osiris,
Ptah and Ra as witnesses.</i>”</p>

</div>

<p>“There, Clem! In all your years of research
among ancient documents have you ever run
across the Luminous Book, the Book of Thoth?
Could it, by any chance, be that mysterious
book made use of long ago by the sorcerers and
magician attached to the great Temple of Amen
at Thebes? If such be the case, it is an undoubted
reference to the book from which Moses
studied, the source of Aaron’s successful attempt
to confound the magicians of Pharaoh.
At any rate, Clem, you will agree with me
that this faded sheet, this last will and testament
of the old architect, may turn out to be of
far greater interest than even this splendid
copy of the Ritual. I wonder if the will was
placed in the Ritual on purpose or through the
carelessness of someone. Hotepra himself it
may have been, three thousand years ago!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>Dr. Gardiner smiled at his friend’s enthusiasm:
“One thing at a time, Steven! Yes, I
have met with the Book of Thoth before. And
in each and every case it was referred to as a
book containing magical incantations of great
power. In one case an unknown architect states
that he ‘<i>raised this monument whose pylons
reach the dome of heaven by means of the magic
Book of Thoth</i>.’ Your man, Amenhotep, son
of Hap, has left an inscription, now in the Leiden
Museum, in which he affirms that he ‘<i>possessed
the Eye of Horus</i>’—whatever that may
mean—and further that he was ‘<i>one who knew
all the Wisdom contained in the Book of Thoth,
scribe of the Gods</i>.’ That this was no empty
boast we may sight the stupendous temples
raised by him at Thebes, not forgetting ‘the
Colossi,’ which alone would have assured him
undying fame, if indeed he erected them. The
tomb to which he refers in this testament is
thought to be beneath the Temple of Der el-Medinet.
Possibly it is included in your concession,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
Steven. Your men may stumble upon
the mummy of Amenhotep, Magic Book and
all!”</p>

<p>Dr. Gardiner turned to his wife: “Well, Dear!
We must be off, to help Ali with the packing. I
hope you have a successful winding up of the
diggings, Steven!”</p>

<p>“And Steven,” broke in his wife, “do let
those abominable old brick ruins alone and hunt
for the Book instead. By the way, do you suppose
Hotepra had a wife? The name is similar
to that of Potiphar?”</p>

<p>“My dear,” interposed Gardiner, as he
assumed an expression of shocked delicacy,
“the subject is hardly one for a bride to discuss,
especially as Great High Priests of Amen, by
the uninitiated at least, are <em>presumed</em> to have
had no wives.”</p>

<p>He turned to Ranney: “Steven, we both hope
that you can stop over at ‘Sevenoaks’ as
usual, for a few days at least, on your way
through to Liverpool. Whew! It is difficult to
realize that we shall be enjoying the Mediterranean
breezes to-morrow. Which reminds me.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
Tanos, don’t forget to have the Museum authorities
place their <i lang="fr">visé</i> on that statue of Isis.
Bénédict has his eagle eye upon it, and what
Bénédict wishes he usually obtains. A little
<i>baksheesh</i> in the clammy palm of Pintsch Pasha
will help to get it through!”</p>

<p>Dr. Gardiner turned again to his wife: “Now,
Miriam, don’t drop that goblet! We could
never pay for it, though I read manuscripts
until the crack of doom!”</p>

<p>With exaggerated care Mrs. Gardiner restored
the beautiful goblet to its place. She
then shook hands with Tanos, reiterated her
husband’s wish that Professor Ranney visit
them in their new home, and left on the arm of
Dr. Gardiner.</p>

<p>Steven Ranney turned to the Greek: “Tanos,
put the scroll in your safe until I return. The
will of Amenhotep I will take with me. I want
to show it to Todros Pasha. He’s pretty
familiar with the tombs of the western bank.
I’ll see you in about three weeks’ time. Meanwhile,
if you manage to get that statue of
Hathor from Nahman, I’ll take it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>With a friendly nod the young American
again braved the heat of the unprotected sidewalk.</p>

<p>Ranney took his way northward, along the
Sharia Kamel, in the direction of Doctor Braintree’s
tree-embowered villa.</p>

<p>During his three days’ relaxation from the
strain of acting as chief-of-excavations amid the
heat and dust of work in Upper Egypt, Ranney
had contrived to see more of Susan Braintree
than usually fell to his lot. Ranney had loved
her from the very first moment he had seen her,
and that was as far back as February, nearly
two months!</p>

<p>It is unnecessary to describe Susan. Ranney
did that in every letter he wrote home to his
mother and sister in beautiful Greenwich, Connecticut.
Susan was there described as a paragon
of beauty and sweetness. Yet, there seemed
to be a fly in the ointment. A tall and “not a
bad looking sort of chap,” so Ranney described
him, a lieutenant of the Seaforth Highlanders,
apparently caused Steven not a little worry. It
seemed that back in their Highland home he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
lived in the same Scottish village as the Braintrees,
brother and sister.</p>

<p>“By George, I’ll take old Amenhotep’s will
to Braintree’s dinner to-night. I’m sure Susan
will be interested; at any rate, she’ll pretend to
be, bless her. Perhaps she’ll find it more to her
taste than that Egyptian flint knife I showed
her yesterday. Yet, I am surprised that a surgeon’s
sister, and a head-nurse at that, should
evince such horror of a knife, even though that
ancient instrument had served the embalmer to
make the last great incision.”</p>

<p>Late that evening, after a few short but blissful
hours spent by Susan’s side—Lieutenant
Angus Hector McPherson being then on duty at
the Garrison—Ranney threw his kitbag into a
sleeper of the night train to Upper Egypt.</p>

<p>After some ten hours of fitful sleep amidst
the choking dust and fine sand which would persist
in floating into the compartment, Steven
Ranney found himself once again upon the very
modern station platform of Thebes, the world’s
most ancient city.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II<br />
<span class="smcap smaller">A Fall Down Thirty Centuries</span></h2>

<p class="dropcap">The research work conducted by Professor
Ranney, as chief of the Yale expedition to
Egypt, had lain in and about the site of
the Mortuary Temple of King Amenhotep the
Third, well-named “Magnificent.” The low
depression which to-day marks the site of this
once gorgeous edifice lies well down upon the
broad Theban Plain, and immediately fronts
that long line of rocky mounds, refuse heaps
and ruined tombs which rises, tier upon tier,
along the lower slopes of the towering Libyan
Hills.</p>

<p>It had been a site of rare possibilities from an
Egyptologist’s point of view. On this account
excavation privileges hereabouts had been
sought by representatives of every great museum
or seat-of-learning both in the Old World
and the New.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>When, finally, the news was telegraphed from
Cairo that this most coveted concession had
fallen to the Yale Expedition, and that together
with a substantial area of the unexplored
mounds to the north and south of the temple
site, great had been Professor Ranney’s joy.</p>

<p>The recent unearthing of the body and rich
treasure of Pharaoh Akhten-aton, son to that
Pharaoh by whom the temple was built, and the
discovery of the rich and comprehensive tomb-equipment
of Akhten-aton’s father and mother-in-law,
together with the marvelously preserved
mummies of those ancient worthies, had fired
the dampened ardor both of the workers in the
field, and, more important still, perhaps, of
those holders of the purse-strings, the sponsors
for the expedition at home.</p>

<p>As I have said above, the site of King Amenhotep’s
Mortuary Temple had been freely acknowledged
to be a very promising one, and so
far these hopes had been entirely justified.</p>

<p>Many and rare had been the finds during the
season’s work now drawing to a close. And it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
was not improbable that some other find of the
first importance might still fall to the spades of
the excavators during the next few weeks of
work upon the site.</p>

<p>Think what the nearby Temple of Medinet
might at this very moment hold for Professor
Ranney! The tomb of Amenhotep, son
of Hap; the Magic Book of the Sorcerers of
Pharaoh, the Luminous Book of Thoth!</p>

<p>Had they had the least suspicion of Professor
Ranney’s secret it is safe to say that many of
his brother scientists would gladly have bartered
five years of their lives for a chance at the
site. And yet, could any one of those enthusiasts
have foreseen the disaster that would here befall
him, not a man among them would have approached
it.</p>

<p>But let us take up the tale, as long as we may,
in Professor Ranney’s own words.</p>

<p>I had recently completed my work in and
about the site of the Mortuary Temple of the
illustrious Pharoah Amenhotep the Third and
had already promised myself a trial excavation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
at the nearby tomb of Pharaoh’s famous architect
and namesake, Amenhotep, when something
unexpected occurred to effectually put an end to
all my plans. What that something was you
shall now hear!</p>

<p>As near as I can piece together the amazing
threads of my story, this is what happened to
me that last eventful evening in Thebes. My
diary, in part, supplies the clue.</p>

<p>Under date of April 28, 1913, and immediately
following the rough translation of a great
memorial tablet which had been found the previous
day, I note this entry: “<i>Sandstorm just
blown over. Headache, feverish. Finished
making plan of palace to scale</i>.”</p>

<p>Now, in spite of the temperature and headache
to which I here refer, and which, had I not
been so keen on my work, I should most certainly
have recognized as a symptom of trouble
to come, I had evidently sought to catch up
with a somewhat neglected report of the season’s
work.</p>

<p>This occupation had apparently kept me at my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
desk well on towards dawn. I deduce this from
the fact that immediately following the above
short entry, I find a number of fragmentary
hieroglyphic inscriptions having to do with the
history of the foundation and erection of
Pharaoh’s Mortuary Temple, upon which I had
been so long at work.</p>

<p>One of these entries is of special interest in
this connection, since, after a lapse of some
three thousand years, the two colossal statues
of King Amenhotep III, to whom it refers, may
still be seen gazing stolidly and immutably eastward
across the broad reaches of the Theban
Plain.</p>

<p>The following graphic description of the now
vanished building itself, a literal translation
from the original hieroglyphic, is the last entry
in my diary, the last for many a long day, I may
add. Further, and for an excellent reason, this
last entry was never completed. The translation
runs in the following somewhat grandiloquent
and semi-poetic vein: “It hath been given
me to set up in a holy place two great statues<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
of the Son of Ra, Amenhotep, Conqueror of
Asia. These are they which stand before the
entrance portal of the Mortuary Temple of His
Majesty (Life, Stability and Health to him).
Carved from solid blocks of the hard grit-stone
of On, they tower seventy feet into the air.
Their golden headdresses touch the very dome
of heaven. On either side, gold-capped obelisks
of red granite reach high above the temple
pylons. Four cedar flag-staffs tipped with gold
rise from grooves cut in the sculptured sandstone
of the temple front. The walls of the
temple are carved and richly painted with
scenes representing the Asiatic conquests of
Pharaoh, Lord of Might. Its great bronze
doors are inlaid in gold with the figure of the
God Min of Coptos. Through this jeweled outline
of his ‘double’ twice daily doth the Great
God enter the Holy Sanctuary, there to partake
of the offerings spread upon its jeweled altars.
In his honor are the ceilings covered with true
lazuli of Babylon, its floors enriched with silver
and sprinkled with powdered turquoise. Its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
gleaming walls are engraved with designs representing
the New Year’s procession of the Sun
Barque, from the Northern to the Southern
Apt. Beside the High Altar stands a tablet
thirty feet in height, covered with gold and inlaid
with sard and emerald. Thus is marked
‘The-Place-Where-His-Majesty-Stands-at-the-Sacrificing.’
Beq, son of Beq, carved the statues
and erected the obelisks. Renny, the
Syrian, overlaid and enriched the tablet.”</p>

<p>Inserted here was a drawing of the above
mentioned tablet, and, upon it, the following
additional fragment: “Memorial-tablet found
face downwards. I enclose drawings and translations.
Evidently <em>mine</em> is a very ancient <em>name</em>?
All traces of——.”</p>

<p>Here the diary abruptly stops!</p>

<p>Now, I directly trace the mishap which thereafter
befell me to the discovery of this same
tablet.</p>

<p>A hot day spent in transcribing to paper its
mud-filled inscriptions, and a night devoted to
their decipherment, might well have driven me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
forth in search of the cool breezes to be found
along the higher slopes of the nearby Libyan
Hills.</p>

<p>Yet, in this connection, I must not forget to
mention the contents of a newspaper-clipping
sent me by Gardiner just before he left Alexandria,
a clipping which seems to have a peculiar
meaning, especially in the light of the
curious experiences which I shall presently
relate.</p>

<p>This clipping was found folded carefully in
the page of my Diary opposite that last incomplete
entry to which I have referred.</p>

<p>Beneath a date and the words “Sphinx,
Cairo,” the latter added in Gardiner’s spidery
script, there appear the following extraordinary
paragraphs: “In the Museum of the Louvre
there is a mummy, Catalogue No. 49. It is the
mummy of a woman, and is said to have been
found in one of the Tombs of the Queens, south-west
of the Theban acropolis. The man who
found it was crushed to death within twenty-four
hours after he had touched it, and his assistants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
who hauled it up from the tomb-shaft
died within a few weeks. Three of the carriers
who handled it on the Nile boat died within a
short space of time, and one of the men who
unpacked it at Paris died in great agony within
less than a week after he had played his part in
the work of getting it to its destination. All
these were seemingly natural deaths, but it is
odd that all the men whose fingers touched the
mummy should have died so soon after the
handling. The body of the unknown appears to
have been interred with all the elaboration prescribed
for <em>Queens of the Royal-Blood</em>! The
work of the casemaker was careful in the extreme.
Both granite coffin and gold-covered
casing were of unusual quality and richness.
The many gem-incrustations, with which the
gold cases were inlaid, were similarly of the
richest and rarest materials. Yet, the name of
Meryt, that of a minor priestess of the Temple,
found beneath the pitch which had been smeared
upon the outer casings, seemed to prove conclusively
that the body was that of one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
chantresses of the Temple of Sekhmet at Karnak.</p>

<p>“But, following the unwinding of the aromatic
wrappings which swathed the body, the curator
in charge was surprised to find a second inscription.
This indicated that the mummy was
that of Queen Hanit, the first wife of Amenhotep
the Third, whom the King put aside in
favor of Thi, a beautiful Syrian. You may recall
how Queen Thi, following Hanit’s incarceration
in the great Temple of Sekhmet, is supposed to
have instigated the death of Hanit’s son, the
true heir to the throne, at the hands of Menna,
a favorite of hers. Of the further history of
Lady Hanit I personally know nothing.”</p>

<p>Along the margin Gardiner had added: “I
send this to you, Ranney, knowing your interest
in the period which the name of Hanit suggests.
Can you unravel the mystery surrounding the
mummy of this Queen who is not a Queen?</p>

<p>“In regard to the sudden taking off of the
seven workmen, and, by the way, the curator is
now dead, I can hear you expatiate at length<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
upon the fearful ‘<i>hekau-spells</i>’ and ‘<i>magic incantations</i>’
of the ancients!</p>

<p>“Once more I ask you to prove to me that your
ancients ever possessed such powers, or if they
did, that they could by any possible chance have
survived the wear and tear of three thousand
years! And, meanwhile, allow me to submit
myself, your unbelieving friend!”</p>

<p>I smile even now, as I shake my head at Gardiner’s
careless words.</p>

<p>What can I but think? Childish, you say! A
series of remarkable coincidences! Wait!</p>

<p>It was from Burton that I first heard an account
of what he and the other members of the
expedition supposed, and rightly, had happened
to me.</p>

<p>It seemed that I left my tent about dawn and
started for one of my favorite walks westward,
taking the general direction of a certain lofty
spur of the deep red Libyan Hills. This jutting
ledge immediately overhung the ruins of King
Mentuhotep’s temple. So close a part of the
towering cliff is this sadly mutilated structure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
that one might easily slip from the shelf above
and fall directly upon the great stone passage-way
which conducts to the inner chamber.</p>

<p>To this somewhat dangerous vantage-point, I
had sometimes taken distinguished visitors to
our camp, people who had come with letters
from friends at home, or those who I felt sure
would be willing to put up with the discomforts
of a night spent beyond the walls of the luxurious
Winter Palace Hotel.</p>

<p>I think I may say truthfully, that not one of
my visitors failed of being more than repaid for
any trifling discomfort which was theirs, since
few scenes can equal, certainly none surpass, the
view presented by the extended vista north,
south and eastward across the winding Nile
Valley towards Karnak, Luxor, and the deep
blue Eastern Hills.</p>

<p>But to return to my story. That memorable
morning the fever must assuredly have had me
well within its clutches. Since, of that early
morning walk, I remember but a single incident—Heaven
knows, I am never likely to forget it—a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
great black void into which I suddenly pitched,
a horrible tingling in all my veins, a shock and a
myriad of little flames that seemed to burst
from my very eyeballs!</p>

<p>Was I conscious, I asked myself! I must be,
for I seemed to realize at once what a dreadful
thing had happened to me.</p>

<p>Of course, I knew I had pitched headlong into
the open mouth of one of those rock-hewn tombs
with which the tumbled slopes below the Libyan
Hills are perforated. Well might those crumbling
hills been named a honey-comb of death!</p>

<p>I could not move; my whole body seemed
numb. By gazing upward I found that I could
see the stars! Yes, I recognized the star of
Hathor, in all her radiant beauty.</p>

<p>How my head ached! How my ears roared!
Worse than all was the agony of a ceaseless
throb-throb, beat-beat, at the back of my head.</p>

<p>It was as though someone were hitting me
with a hammer, rhythmically, relentlessly.</p>

<p>Perhaps after all I <em>was</em> dead!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>No, there were the sharp outlines of the tomb-shaft
and the stars above!</p>

<p>I wonder whose tomb it is? Is it charted?
Oh, will that throbbing never stop? Won’t
someone come? Help! Help!</p>

<p>As if in answer to my cry, high above me I
saw a queer, yet strikingly familiar figure, a
figure silhouetted black against the sky.</p>

<p>The figure leaned over and gazed downwards
into the shaft. I noticed its long and thickly
curled wig.</p>

<p>“Ha, ha! A wig of the New Empire,” said I
to myself.</p>

<p>Its owner’s face I could not see, but he—or
she—yes, it was a woman, peered long and
earnestly into the gloomy depths of the shaft
where I lay.</p>

<p>Suddenly, and as though through the medium
of some unnatural light, her face was revealed.</p>

<p>“I was right,” thought I. “It <em>is</em> a woman,
and by her robes, a woman of the New Empire!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>But what features, what an expression!
Never shall I forget it. A face of the most
exotic beauty; of a type I knew instantly. It
could only have belonged to one of the ladies
of the house of Amenhotep the Magnificent!
Such a face the Royal Sculptor Beq might carve,
or Amenhotep, Superintendent of the Royal
Craftsmen.</p>

<p>The beautiful apparition addressed me in the
soft tones of the educated Egyptian.</p>

<p>I found that I could rise without difficulty at
her bidding. Struggling to my feet I pushed a
stone at the side of the tomb chamber and
passed through a narrow false door which
opened as my hand pressed the secret block. I
found myself once more out under the sunset
glow.</p>

<p>All this seemed perfectly natural to me. But,
I remember thinking how strange it was that I
should find the pyramids of the Antefs and
Mentuhoteps, the sphinx-lined Causeways, and
the many Mortuary Temples hereabouts, standing
clearly defined against the hills, and seemingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
in all their original beauty. Nay, the very
cypresses, palms, karobs and myrrh trees which
flanked the ivory-toned Causeway leading to
Queen Hatshepsut’s Temple, were to be seen
nodding gracefully in the evening breeze.</p>

<p>My gaze fell questionably upon the smiling
face of my adorable savior.</p>

<p>She must have remarked my bewilderment.
Yet, without a word she turned and started
swiftly toward a small white house half-concealed
in a dense grove of feathery acacias.</p>

<p>In response to a quick gesture on the part of
my guide, I pulled back the wooden bolt and
opened the door. A tall and strikingly handsome
Egyptian arose from an ivory-inlaid stool
as I entered. Carefully rolling up a manuscript
which he had been reading by the light of an oil
lamp, and without otherwise appearing to notice
me, he took from the table nearby a blue glazed
goblet, handed it to my rescuer, and re-seated
himself.</p>

<p>Once again he picked up the discarded manuscript
and continued his reading as though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
nothing had happened to interrupt his train of
thought.</p>

<p>Perhaps, after all, I had been expected! I
heard my charming guide utter the one softly
sibilant Egyptian word: <i>Drink!</i></p>

<p>I lifted the bright blue goblet to my lips and
drank deeply, thirstily....</p>

<span class="smcap smaller">Enana, the Magician, Would Prove That a Resemblance Between a Queen
and a Priestess May Be Turned to His Advantage.</span></h2>

<p class="dropcap">The sloping walls of the Temple of
Amenra loomed black and forbidding
against the pallid light of early morning.</p>

<p>The tall cedar flag-poles fronting the entrance
pylons and the gold-capped shafts of the four
granite obelisks seemed carved in ebony, so
sharply were their dark lines defined.</p>

<p>No sound came from within; no life was apparent
in the wide domain of cultivated fields
which surrounded the temple on three sides.
There was no sign of life upon the temple
barges moored to the sandstone landing at the
temple front.</p>

<p>A long line of cranes flew slowly, noiselessly,
across the moon, now rapidly sinking into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
blue haze which floated above the Western Hills.</p>

<p>Within the temple precinct, in a small chamber
lit by the fitful light of a six-wicked lamp
which swung out from the wall at the end of a
pole, a restless figure bent from time to time
above a form stretched at length upon a high
couch.</p>

<p>The figure was that of a woman, a woman
dead and to a certain extent disfigured by the
scalpel and fat-extracting implements of the embalmer
who now bent over her.</p>

<p>On a low bench beside him were spread out
the many bronze and flint utensils of his craft.</p>

<p>Kathi, the Embalmer, made the last great incision.
With a long, flat and minutely serrated
flint knife, he laid open a good six inches of the
flesh immediately above the heart. Having extracted
that organ he carefully placed it in an
alabaster jar filled almost to the brim with aromatic
spirits. On top of the jar he set the cover,
a cover crowned with a tinted portrait-head of
the deceased. Three similar jars containing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
viscera, brains and other organs liable to rapid
decay, had already been hermetically sealed.</p>

<p>So quickly comes the dawn in Egypt that, by
this time, one could readily distinguish the inscription
in letters of dark blue which symmetrically
filled a square at the shoulder of each
vase:</p>

<p>“An oblation which the King bestows to the
Royal Spouse, His Beloved, Hanit, Triumphant.
Ten thousand oxen and fowl, ten thousand jars
of wine, ten thousand loaves of bread, funerary
raiment for the rewrapping of this body, all
things pure and good for the soul of the deceased
Queen, His Beloved, the Lady Hanit,
Justified of God.”</p>

<p>Being at one and the same time Embalmer to
the King, Chief Surgeon and Magician, as he
macerated the shriveled flesh, Kathi recited the
prescribed Ritual from the Book of the Dead
and consecrated the many amuletic jewels and
pendants with which he now proceeded to
decorate the body.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>Each limb received at his hand the anointing
that rendered it incorruptible and the magical
charms and incantations that should sustain the
spark of life.</p>

<p>This done, Kathi placed a heavy amulet in the
cavity whence he had extracted the heart, a
great emerald beetle, inscribed beneath with a
prayer for justification and absolution addressed
to the Judge of the Dead, Osiris.</p>

<p>It did not enter Kathi’s head that he was
trying to dupe Osiris by thus inserting a heavy
stone heart in place of the real organ. Kathi
merely wished to be sure that the heart would
tip the scales against the great God’s “Feather
of Truth,” when the deceased was led into the
Hall of the Underworld for Judgment.</p>

<p>Having placed the emerald heart in position,
the Embalmer set a long oval plaque of gold
immediately above it, drew together the clean-cut
flesh and sewed up the wound.</p>

<p>A small iron amulet, the Two Fingers of
Horus, he placed in the hand, and the delicate
jewels of the deceased, chains of minute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
carnelian emerald, garnet and amethyst pendants,
he strung about the throat. Low upon the
breast he placed a beaded <i>wesekh</i>, a broad
jeweled pectoral ornament which, more than a
thousand years before his time, King Kufu
had called <em>the national ornament</em> of his people.
Upon the head he set one of the huge pleated
wigs of the day, confining it with a diadem of
gold decorated at intervals with gold lotus
flowers in high relief. Gold earrings of rosette
form were set in the ears, broad jeweled bands
slipped upon the arms, wrists and ankles, and
Kathi, the Embalmer, commenced to wrap the
body in the first few score feet of aromatic
linen bandages.</p>

<p>The Embalmer rested a moment, hand on hip.
Humming absently to himself he turned to trim
the spluttering lamp. It was an occupation
which consumed altogether too much of his time.</p>

<p>Kathi’s back being turned for a moment, he
failed to see the bent figure of Enana, the
Magician, who glided into the dimly lit room.</p>

<p>“Thou hast succeeded, son of Kathi?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>At his repressed but high-pitched voice,
Kathi, son of Kathi, swung about, startled for
an instant out of his wonted calm and immobility.
He turned to close the door before
replying. “As thou sayest, Holiness, I have
succeeded. ’Tis but a few short minutes since
Thi and Menna stood where thou standest at this
very moment. The Syrian shed real tears above
the body of that poor wench there. To her
’twas Hanit, doubt not.” Kathi smiled somewhat
sadly as he gazed down upon the figure at
his feet: “In death the Lady Meryt’s striking
resemblance to Hanit, our beloved Queen, was
most pronounced. And, following my work
upon the head, the Lady Meryt’s own mother
could hardly have chosen between them.</p>

<p>“I noted a hint of suspicion in Menna’s eyes
the moment he entered the room. Yet, this
instantly vanished, when once he had looked
upon the body. He smiled. Menna no longer
fears that Hanit will take vengeance for the
murder of her son. To Menna, as to Thi, the
body is that of Hanit. Their triumph seems to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
them assured. Hanit and Wazmes, her son, are
dead. Thi’s son reigns! The Syrian sun-god
triumphs over Amen!”</p>

<p>Enana, Chief Magician of the Temple of
Amen, rubbed together his lean and shriveled
hands. His experiment seemed well on the road
to success.</p>

<p>A Pharaoh might set aside one queen for
another; the late Pharaoh had done that. He
might depose a queen of the line of the sun-god
Ra in favor of Thi, a Syrian, a commoner. Beguiled
by the latter’s crafty wiles he might close
his eyes to the murder of an inconvenient son or
so. ’Twas harem work that! But, to strike at
the great God Amenra whom Enana served—that
was a different matter!</p>

<p>Thi, the Queen-Mother, was a foreigner, an
idolator. The present Chancellor was also a
Syrian, Yakab of Rabbath.</p>

<p>Was it to be wondered at that the present
Pharaoh, Thi’s son, was daily urged to overthrow
the gods whom Egypt worshiped in
favor of Aton, the <em>Syrian</em> god?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>But what then would become of the great gods
Amen, Ptah and Khonsu; of Osiris, Isis, Horus,
and a host of deities worshiped through countless
ages along the valley of the Nile? And last,
but well to the fore in Enana’s vision, what
would become of the innumerable priests, himself
included, who served those powerful gods?</p>

<p>Yes! Menna could strangle Hanit’s only son,
the lawful heir; Thi could seek to poison Hanit!
But, touch the cult of Amen of Thebes and, at a
word, the great priestly hierarchy throughout
Egypt would rise as one man.</p>

<p>So, at least, thought Enana. So too Huy, First
Prophet of Amen, his brother, and so Kathi, the
Embalmer, their hireling.</p>

<p>If it was to resolve itself into a clash between
Court and Temple (and, certainly, recent events
had pointed to a rupture) Enana and the
Prophets of Amen were ready.</p>

<p>Enana’s small black eyes fixed themselves
upon those of the Embalmer who perceptibly
cringed. He laid one thin hand upon Kathi’s
shoulder: “Son of Kathi, thy skill is that of thy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
revered father (peace in Aaru be his), nay,
more excellent! For what man was ever called
upon to do the work that thou hast done?”
Enana pointed to the figure lying half-concealed
in the shadows of the room. “Verily in thee
hath Amen a faithful follower, one whose
reward shall surely find him.</p>

<p>“Listen, son of Kathi. The long-expected hour
has come. Pharaoh, Thi and the Syrians about
them can no longer conceal their plan to bring
about a civil war. Jealous of our power, Thi and
Yakab have decided to challenge the supremacy
of all-mighty Amen. The priesthood of Egypt
is to be overthrown. Hook-nosed Syrians and
Canaanites are to be installed in our stead, and
our beloved banks of Hapi are to be overrun
with the kinsmen of Yakab, the Chancellor, may
the twenty-four demigods blast him!</p>

<p>“Yet, mark my words, son of Kathi. Though
Aton seem to triumph yet, in the end, shall
Amen find his own. Though all the powers of
the conjurers of Amen be counted in vain, yet
shall Amen triumph through Enana, his servant.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
More I cannot tell thee at this time.
Yet, through troublous days to come, remember
my words.”</p>

<p>With a muttered farewell the aged Magician
shuffled off down the narrow acacia-bordered
path which led to the landing-stage by the side
of the river.</p>

<p>Kathi stood watching Enana’s bent figure
until it disappeared down the sandstone steps
which led to the ferry.</p>

<p>Like Enana, his master, Kathi was above all
a devoted follower of the great god Amen,
whose worship the Queen-Mother now sought to
destroy.</p>

<p>Yet, of late, there had been many moments
such as this when Kathi had felt the bow-string
at his throat, the arms of the strangler about
his neck. Kings deal harshly with conspirators
and Kathi, the Embalmer, whose horizon might
well be said to have been circumscribed by
death, feared to die.</p>

<p>Kathi’s fears were somewhat dissipated at
sight of the onrushing sun-god, now vaulting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
higher and higher above the rosy Eastern Hills.
He stretched forth his hands, palms upward, in
that appealing attitude of prayer so suggestive
of a spiritual offering.</p>

<p>On the river below him the boatmen burst
into the Hymn to Ra at his Rising, which had
been first sung by the Sage and Prophet Imhotep,
two thousand years before their time!</p>

<p>Nature, too, added her welcome to the nurturing
sun-god. The falcons sailed in great circles
above the flashing waters of the river. To their
shrill and quavering notes, intermingled with
the joyous twitterings and flitterings back and
forth of other birds, there was added the soft
lowing of the sacred cows and the shrill chattering
of the apes belonging to the Temple of Mut
in Asheru.</p>

<p>Beams of light seemed to dance upon the gold
caps of the lofty obelisks. Huge streamers rose
upon the flag-poles which fronted the great
portal of the sun-god’s mightiest temple.</p>

<p>Along the walls of the temple of the deified
King Thomes, a phyle of chanting priests<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
moved slowly, the <i>keri heb</i> with his tube-like
censer at their head. Kathi found it next to
impossible to believe that a hideous civil war
was about to burst upon such peace as this.</p>

<p>Kathi shook his head. He turned once more
to his unfinished task within.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV<br />
<span class="smcap smaller">How Bhanar Came to Thebes</span></h2>

<p class="dropcap">It was about the third hour of the auspicious
sixteenth day of Athyr. On the river a
high-prowed galley of foreign cut could be
seen attempting to gain the western landing
under her own sail. This great sail, picturesquely
marked with broad stripes of green and
dull red, spread itself to the fitful breeze with
but little effect.</p>

<p>Suddenly a raucous command rang out. At
once, as if the command had been momentarily
expected, twenty oars were thrust out from the
vessel’s sides, twenty lusty throats called aloud
upon the name of some god or beneficent demon,
and at each shout the great blades took the
water and the vessel sprang shoreward, a line
of bubbles and swirling eddies in her wake.</p>

<p>A pilot stood at prow and stern. The bow
pilot held a mooring-stake and mallet ready in
his hand. A pair of buffers already hung over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
the vessel’s sides. It was often a dangerous
matter to pick a path through the many barges,
war-galleys, sea-going vessels and lesser river
craft which were strung out as far as the eye
could see along the western bank of the Nile.</p>

<p>“By Hathor,” said Nakht, a fieldhand, as he
fixed his tired eyes upon the oncoming galley,
“a man who can scull, row, and swim as can I,
should have a place upon some such vessel.
Think of the life those dirty Amu lead!” All
foreigners were Amu to Nakht, sand-dwellers
and loathed for their filthy habits and the lice
that covered them.</p>

<p>“Aye, Nakht! Thou mayest well envy them.
Think of the days and nights in port, ever with
gold <i>uten</i> to spend. Think of Thethi’s wine,
Aua’s dancing girls, a brawl with the city watchmen—more
damned foreigners!</p>

<p>“Ai, ai! Once I knew it well! See this scar.
’Twas Thethi himself gave it me. We were
young men then, both as quick as southern
panthers.</p>

<p>“Breath of Ra! How many maidens and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
hapless youths think you Baltu brings to Thebes
this trip?”</p>

<p>A sharp blow from the staff of the overseer
cut short this soliloquy. Once again began the
splashing of waters mingled with the droning
song of the irrigation worker: “Life to this
seed, O Waters, Breath of Osiris, Blood of Isis!
Life to these our seedlings that we may eat and
live to sing thy praises.”</p>

<p>The galley drifted slowly to the bank. The
oars were drawn in; the great steering-oars
alone guided her.</p>

<p>The emblem at the prow of the vessel showed
her to hail from Tyre. Her freight, as Nakht
had hinted, consisted in the main of hapless
youths and maidens torn from the arms of their
murdered parents, enveigled from their homes
by false promises or bought outright in foreign
slave-marts.</p>

<p>Among the jostling crowds gathered upon the
embankment and overlooking the clustered vessels,
stood Renny, the Syrian. His gaze was
fixed upon the forms of two little children busily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
occupied in modeling dolls from the plastic Nile
mud of the river bank. The children’s occupation
had interested him since Renny, the Syrian,
was a sculptor.</p>

<p>Renny was startled out of his state of artistic
introspection by the harsh voices of a number
of the foreign sailors. They had jumped ashore
from the Tyrian galley and now sought to jostle
their way up the steep and crowded bank.</p>

<p>While these swarthy adventurers drove in the
mooring-stake, Renny’s eyes roamed along the
deck of the galley itself. As he gazed at the
ordered cases of merchandise, which had but
recently been brought up on deck preparatory
to their unloading, three figures emerged from a
cabin door placed toward the stern of the vessel.</p>

<p>Renny instantly decided that the first of the
three, a huge man heavily bearded and with a
commanding eye and voice of thunder, was the
master and probable owner of the vessel. The
second was a dainty youth, of a nation unknown
to Renny; the third a woman, by her robes a
Syrian like himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>The merchant made some remark in a tongue
unknown to Renny and, at the same time,
pointed shoreward. The trembling youth replied
by throwing the long sleeve of his rich
robe over his head, a gesture indicative of grief
or despair.</p>

<p>But Renny was far more interested in the
figure of the Syrian, his countrywoman.</p>

<p>What heartless parent had sold that drooping
figure into harsh captivity? What disastrous
war had resulted in her present plight? Or
had this hook-nosed Semite filched her from her
nest high up above some gentle Syrian valley?</p>

<p>The sculptor’s heart ached for her. Thoughts
of his own beloved vineyard flashed through his
mind. For an instant he visualized the purple
hills which encircled Ribba, his native village,
the clear blue sky, the sparkling stream, his
father’s white-walled house and the little temple
which stood, well nigh hidden, near the edge of
an ancient grove.</p>

<p>Poor little exile! Never had Renny so longed
for power, for heavy golden <i>uten</i>, as he did at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
that moment. Instinctively he gripped the
single bar that encircled his left wrist. He
smiled sadly. Fifty, nay, a hundred such, might
not buy her freedom, and this single golden bar
represented the fruits of two years’ untiring
labor under the patronage of a great, if
capricious, noble.</p>

<p>Suddenly his gaze riveted itself more intently
upon the drooping figure of the Syrian woman.
It could not be! Yes! He knew her! ’Twas
Bhanar, a maid of Ribba, of Ribba itself, his
dear Syrian village!</p>

<p>Could his eyes have played him false? He
sauntered carelessly toward the Phoenician vessel.
Yes! It was Bhanar, playmate of his boyhood,
Bhanar whom his dead sister had loved so
devotedly.</p>

<p>In vain he sought to attract her attention.
Finally, through an inspiration, Renny turned
towards the east and gave the shrill cry of the
Syrian hillmen when danger threatened.</p>

<p>The effect was instantaneous. Bhanar’s
drooping form slowly raised itself. Astonishment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
joy and instant recognition passed
rapidly over her beautiful face.</p>

<p>She had seen him; she knew him! With a
warning gesture Renny slowly reclimbed the
embankment.</p>

<p>How to save her? To whom could he turn for
help?</p>

<p>His master—the noble Menna? Small hope
there! The Queen-Mother, herself a Syrian?
Yes, he would attempt to reach the ear of the
powerful Queen-Mother herself!</p>

<p>To do so, he must act quickly. Yakab, her
Syrian chancellor, should be seen and quickly.
Yakab was an importation of the Queen-Mother,
and a favorite of hers.</p>

<p>Renny found Yakab seated beside the pool in
his garden. He affected to be absorbed in a
game of draughts with his youngest daughter.</p>

<p>In a few hurried words Renny acquainted him
with the plight of their countrywoman and
begged his instant help. He drew the golden
bracelet from his wrist but Yakab, smiling,
stopped him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>The latter rose and in a few short words set
Renny’s mind at rest.</p>

<p>In fact, within the minute, they had parted at
Yakab’s stucco gate, Yakab to take a short cut
to the palace, Renny to take his way along the
river bank toward the vast estates of Menna,
the Royal Superintendent, his exalted protector.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V<br />
<span class="smcap smaller">The Pleasure Barge of Thi, the Queen-Mother</span></h2>

<p class="dropcap">During his reign, Pharaoh Amenhotep,
the Magnificent, had set aside or infringed
upon many an established precedent
or custom. It almost seemed as if he had
thus sought to prove to his subjects his utter
infatuation for Thi, the Syrian, his second wife.</p>

<p>For the late Pharaoh had done nothing without
Thi’s cooperation. Though of common extraction,
her name and titles had appeared upon
all state documents beside his own. This was at
once a new and a radical innovation.</p>

<p>Amenhotep’s infatuation for the beautiful Thi
had produced, among many other marvels, a vast
pleasure lake, an artificial body of water, which
now stretched its placid reaches on three sides
of the villa-palace of the former monarch. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
villa was now occupied by Thi and the new
Pharaoh, her son.</p>

<p>About the banks of the broad lake waved
feathery acacia, sweet scented mimosa, marsh
flowers, and tall papyrus plants. Upon its pellucid
waters rested white and blue lotus flowers.
Great cranes, pink and white flamingos and
pure white ibises pecked leisurely among the
lily pads or spread their wings to dry in the
rays of the late afternoon sun.</p>

<p>A sheltered landing-stage opened on a causeway
whose granite flagging led up to the door of
the palace, the Per-aoh or “Great House” as
both the palace and its august master were
called. To the left of this causeway stood a
small building set apart by the art-loving
Pharaoh for experiments in glass and fayence.
To the right lay the series of rooms reserved
to Auta, the Royal Sculptor, and his pupils.
Counted among the latter were the then reigning
Pharaoh, Akhten-aton, and Noferith, his
wife.</p>

<p>Akhten-aton has a great admiration for his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
valiant ancestor Thothmes, third of the name.
He counted among his most prized possessions
a gold goblet said to have been designed and
fashioned by the hand of that gifted Pharaoh.</p>

<p>All Egyptians knew how well the hand of the
great “Conqueror of Asia” had wielded the
curved sword of Amen, and with what marvelous
results alike for the enrichment of Egypt
and for the prestige of her name. Few had ever
guessed that Thothmes’ rare moments of relaxation
had been spent in the studio of his Chief
Goldsmith.</p>

<p>To-day, Akhten-noferu, the “pleasure barge”
of the Queen, was drawn up beside the landing-stage
in anticipation of Thi’s arrival.</p>

<p>Less than a hundred cubits in length, its cedar
beams were covered throughout with thin plates
of pure gold. Its linen sail was ornamented
with squares of blue and red. The blades of the
light cedar oars were tipped with silver; the two
great steering-oars were entirely sheathed in
the same bright metal. A portrait head of the
late Pharaoh was carved upon the handle of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
each of the steering-oars. Two elongated eyes at
the prow of the barge were inlaid with alabaster
and deep Babylonian lazuli. The name of the
vessel appeared inlaid in pale green emerald
from Suan in the south. In the after part of
the vessel a low dais was covered with red and
blue checkered tapestry, to match the great sail.</p>

<p>With half-suppressed giggles of excitement
and whispered jests, the “sailors” now appeared.
Noisily trooping down the causeway
they took their places at the oar benches, as
their leader indicated. Their leader, Princess
Sesen, was as amusingly disguised as her
“sailors,” the handmaidens of the Queen-Mother
herself.</p>

<p>Queen Thi now appeared. As her short figure
passed from the dark shadows of the passage
into the glare of day, two ebony black Nubians
dropped in an arch above her large and profusely
curled wig, a pair of ostrich-feather sunshades
dyed in brilliant tones of red and blue.
The servants fell prostrate at sight of her and
so remained, muttering wishes for “long life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
and health,” until she was safely seated upon
her gilded cedar chair, and a cushion placed at
her feet by little Ata, youngest of her maidens.</p>

<p>At her approach the “sailors” had been
silenced by a warning gesture from the Princess.</p>

<p>Suddenly the momentary decorum of these
little maids was interrupted by a wailing cry
from one of their number, who, without apparent
reason, burst into a violent fit of weeping.</p>

<p>For a few moments she was unable to explain
the reason of her distress. But finally, her sisters
gathered that her turquoise pendant had
slipped from her neck and fallen into the water.
This pendant, a gift from the Princess herself,
the tearful little maiden vowed she must have.
She could not row, she would not row, until it
was found.</p>

<p>After much delay her fears were somewhat
allayed by the Chief Eunuch, who promised to
send for Enana, the Magician. Enana’s incantations
would soon bring to the surface her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
missing jewel. He promised that she would find
it awaiting her when the barge returned to the
landing-stage. Thus, in part reassured, little
Thutu dried her eyes and again bent over her
oar in anticipation of the signal to start.</p>

<p>A trumpeter in the prow blew a shrill note
upon his long instrument (a new importation
from Syria), a group of singing women from
the temple of Sekhmet burst into song; Rahotep,
the Chief Eunuch, clapped his fat hands;
the ropes were cast off, and the forty maidens
dipped their light cedar oars in the placid
waters. The barge “Beauties of the Sun Disc”
drew out slowly into the dancing waters of the
lake.</p>

<p>Seated in the shadow of the great checkered
sail, Queen Thi smiled her appreciation of the
novel surprise which her maidens had prepared
for her. As the vessel drew out through the
nodding lotus flowers Kema’s flute made soft
music which seemed to mingle with the pearling
ripples of the waters. Kema, it seems, played
the flute so well that the cranes and water-fowl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
often lit upon the sides of the barge to hear him.</p>

<p>Queen Thi was not aware that novel entertainments
such as this had been customary with the
Egyptian court from days immemorial. She
was now to hear of just such a method of distraction
as had been practiced under the great
Egyptian monarch Senefru, who had lived, died
and been laid to rest, high up in his colossal
pyramid, some twenty centuries before her time.</p>

<p>For Sianekh, the story-teller, suddenly appeared
and seated herself upon the deck in front
of the Queen’s chair. As was her custom, she
neglected both the prostration and the formulæ
of greeting. Sianekh was a privileged character
at Court, a favorite with the late King,
both on account of her inexhaustible fund of
stories and because of the fact that Pepi, her
husband, had lost his life while defending his
royal master from the attack of a wounded lion.</p>

<p>Yes! Thi’s obese and indolent husband, the
late Pharaoh, had once been inordinately fond
of lion-hunting. One hundred and two lions he
had killed with his own arrows. One had gone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
down upon the very expedition so fatal to his
chariot-driver, Pepi. But it was the last animal
of that great hunt which had sent Sianekh’s
husband to the Valley of Shadows. Pharaoh
never forgot Pepi’s sacrifice. Pepi’s tomb
never lacked its offerings of beer, wine and milk,
flesh and fowl or of fresh white linens for the
rewrapping of his mummy.</p>

<p>Sianekh, the story-teller, slipped from the
sleeve of her loose white mantle a small ebony
wand tipped with electrum.</p>

<p>Without preamble she commenced a tale of
King Senefru’s days, a tale of the epoch of
those gods of old, the pyramid-builders.</p>

<p>In her monotonous singsong she told how the
good king, tired with the cares of state and oppressed
by the great heat of noonday, sought a
cool spot in which to rest, and found it not.
How his son flew upstream in the fleetest royal
barge in search of a famous magician. How
he found him fishing in the Nile without a hook,
and finally persuaded him to come to his
father’s court.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>She told of the wonders performed there by
the aged seer. Of wine turned to honey. Of
bees which went into a little hive only to emerge
as brilliantly colored birds resembling those of
distant Punt. Of the goose’s head which he
restored to its body so that it sprang once more
to its feet and rushed cackling and hissing from
their midst.</p>

<p>Finally she told of Senefru’s pleasure-barge,
of the little maidens who rowed it and of one of
their number who dropped her pendant into the
water, even as had Thutu, and of the magician
of old who parted the waters and descended
dryshod to the finding of the pendant.</p>

<p>“But see, O Queen. Enough of the doings of
the ancients. There is the tablet to the faithful
Nakht, a hero of our own day and generation.”
Sianekh pointed to a tall shaft which rose high
above the bank. “That tall shaft marks the
stake where Nakht met his death. The story
goes that Isis, only daughter of the Vizier
Rames, made an appointment to meet the son
of Nakht at this spot. Yonder inlet was filled to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
overflowing with the waters of the inundation.
But Nakht, son of Nakht, rather than abandon
his tryst, let the swirling waters of the inundation
flow over his devoted head. Isis threw herself
into the waters with him. To this date
lovers hang garlands about the shaft and
breathe a prayer to Hathor for sons and
daughters like Nakht and Isis.”</p>

<p>As Sianekh rose to her feet the Queen thanked
her and presented her with a pair of gold earrings
which she unfastened from her own ears,
an unheard of honor, and one which even the
story-teller appreciated.</p>

<p>The Eunuchs showed their approbation by
loud cries of affected astonishment, for the
stories were not new to them. But the little
maidens, who had rested on their oars during
the recital, showed their keen delight in the tales
by frequent “oh’s” and “ah’s” of astonishment
and approval scattered throughout the
telling.</p>

<p>On the barge the hours slipped by unnoted.
To Yakab the Chancellor, who now anxiously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
awaited the return of the Queen, each minute
seemed an hour.</p>

<p>Yakab had hurried off to acquaint the Queen
of Bhanar’s plight, and to beg her to come to
the assistance of one of her unfortunate country-women.</p>

<p>Hour after hour Yakab was compelled to sit
beneath the striped awning which fronted the
palace door. Hour after hour he pretended to
listen to the doorkeeper’s account of his exploits
amidst the Nubian goldfields, in the arid Turquoise
Country, among the hills of Mitanni or
beyond the Great Bend of the Euphrates.</p>

<p>Pentaur, the Doorkeeper, had served three
successive Pharaohs. Already was he popularly
supposed to have exceeded the one hundred and
ten years customarily prayed for by all pious
Egyptians. Yet, Pentaur seemed to have the
key to some mysterious <i>hekau</i>-charm, which
kept his well-worn teeth in his head, his deep-set
eyes clear and his head erect. Though Pentaur
walked with a jackal-headed cane, it was from
choice, and not necessity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>Like all men, Pentaur had his failings. Next
to the somewhat colored recital of his own
travels and successes, Pentaur loved to recount
the exploits, narrow escapes and journeyings of
his famous ancestor and namesake, Pentaur,
companion and histographer of that greatest of
all Pharaohs, Thothmes the Great. As he listened,
perforce, to this garrulous descendant of
Pentaur, Yakab wondered if it had indeed been
the fiery Thothmes who had crushed Nubia and
the whole of Asia, or whether the first Pentaur
had not in point of fact been the true instrument
of Pharaoh’s worldwide successes.</p>

<p>Yet, much of what the Doorkeeper said of his
ancestor was true. Was not Pentaur the Historian’s
account of Pharaoh’s exploits written
in good hieroglyphic and graphically pictured
upon the walls of Amen’s temple nearby? Indeed,
Pentaur, the Doorkeeper, had good cause
for his pride of ancestry.</p>

<p>The weary Yakab was on the point of relinquishing
his long vigil when the notes of a
trumpet announced the return of the royal
barge. Soon after Pentaur sent in Yakab’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
crumpled note to the Queen-Mother’s apartment.</p>

<p>Once the acknowledgment was in his hands,
Yakab picked up his long staff and rose to depart.
As his gaunt form passed beneath the
outer pylon, Pentaur motioned him back to the
ebony stool. Pentaur considered Yakab an excellent
conversationalist, for the reason, perhaps,
that Pentaur’s flow of anecdote had not
once been interrupted.</p>

<p>But Yakab smilingly shook his head. He
could not resist following up his heart-felt expressions
of farewell with a sarcastic prayer
for the repose of the souls of Pentaur’s ancestry,
as far as he could recall it, commencing with
Den, one of the valiant “Followers of Horus”
of the days of the gods.</p>

<p>Yakab feared that he had failed a member
of his race. He had been too late. Yakab loved
riches; Yakab loved power. But, above all else,
Yakab loved his home, his family, his people.
And was not Bhanar one of his people?</p>

<p>That night Yakab could not sleep.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI<br />
<span class="smcap smaller">How Bhanar Found a Home in Egypt</span></h2>

<p class="dropcap">Baltu the Phoenician left his bales of
merchandise and returned to the side of
the trembling Bhanar. Erdu, his steersman
could count the bales as well as he. As
each tenth bale passed over the vessel’s side,
Erdu sang out the tally. He checked it with a
mark upon a piece of potsherd which he held in
his hand.</p>

<p>Misunderstanding the signs of excitement
which appeared in the face of the trembling
Bhanar, following Renny’s signal, the Phoenician
merchant sought to interest her in the
sights about her. In a few moments she would
be off his hands forever. She must not be allowed
to break down at this juncture.</p>

<p>In a voice which he sought to make sympathetic
Baltu pointed out the wonders of the
Western Bank.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>He named the builders of the various temples,
shrines and gold-capped obelisks; the owners of
the more important villas whose gardens lined
the river bank. He even attempted to give some
chronological sequence to the intricate maze of
rock-hewn tombs which rose, vast and imposing,
from the edge of the Theban Plain to a point
high up beneath the crumbling cliffs of the
western hills.</p>

<p>Yet, Bhanar found little of interest in her
surroundings. Her eyes dwelt fearfully upon
the treeless hills, upon the mud-walled villages
and gloomy temples. She noted that each and
all of the Theban temples were guarded from
the eyes of mortals by high and forbidding walls
of solid masonry.</p>

<p>How different was this to the hospitality of
her own little temple, whose snowy colonnades
were open to every passerby; its great wooden
doors thrown open from sunrise to sunset!
Again, in contradistinction to these sun-baked
hills her native village nestled in an olive grove,
its encircling hills were green with pastures and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
crowned with thickly growing trees. At this
very season its fields were yellow with the fragrant
Syrian crocus. Over all was a sky blue as
a turquoise, an atmosphere pure and limpid.
How different from the blazing heat of Egypt
and that great throbbing cauldron of molten
brass which the Egyptians called their sky!</p>

<p>Presently she would be swallowed up in one
of those forbidding temples, palaces or villas!
She thought that the well of her tears had dried,
yet now the tears sprang hot and blinding to her
eyes.</p>

<p>Fearing that she might ruin his chances if she
lost that soft rose coloring he so prized, to
divert her Baltu led her to the cabin door and
bade her robe herself to go ashore. Baltu took
from his long fringed gown two small gold-capped
jars of obsidian and placed them in her
hands: “Descend to thy cabin, my Rose-bud.
Bid Darman let down that glossy hair of thine.
Let her sprinkle a little of this perfumed oil and
gold dust upon it. The oil is more precious
than the gold. Let her not waste a drop. Now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
haste thee, my Syrian Crocus! We go ashore
immediately.”</p>

<p>Soon Bhanar was arrayed in a cream-colored
robe, a golden girdle encircled her slender waist,
a diadem gleamed in her perfumed hair.</p>

<p>Darman stood back to admire the effect of her
ministrations. Darman, like Bhanar, snatched
from some distant village, was short, fat and
continually sniffling or weeping outright. She
had often assured Bhanar, as indeed she had
assured other unfortunates whom it had been
her lot to serve in a like capacity, that the love
and devotion which she bore her, alone prevented
her from throwing herself overboard.</p>

<p>In the present case it may well have been the
truth, for Darman had conceived an utter infatuation
for the beautiful Syrian. On the contrary,
Darman loathed her loud-voiced master,
though her abject fear of him was cause for jest
with the whole crew, including Baltu himself.</p>

<p>In spite of her threats to do away with herself
Darman had now spent six years upon the
Tyrian’s vessel. During this time she had prepared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
hundreds of timorous maidens for their
first, and last, appearance upon the slave-traders’
dais. When the owner grew tired of
his new plaything, like the playthings of infancy,
it disappeared. No one knew whither,
no one cared.</p>

<p>Bhanar reappeared on deck to find Baltu in
the act of teasing the unfortunate youth, who
now lay prostrate at his feet in an agony of fear
and apprehension.</p>

<p>“Up! Dry those woman’s tears, Page of
Pharaoh! Dost wish a tombkeeper to purchase
thee? Queen Ataho’s page servitor to a
mummy! Pull thyself together, boy! Otherwise”—Baltu
closed his eyes, folded his hands
across his chest and assumed the rigid pose of
a mummy.</p>

<p>As his eyes opened he caught sight of the advancing
Bhanar: “Astar’s doves! Did I not
tell thee Darman, ‘A robe of cream, transparent,
bordered with green and gold, dainty
sandals of pink and gold, a simple gold diadem
and the hair parted in the center—so!’ Seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
through such Syrian byssus that rosy form proclaims
thee Astar’s daughter. Ah, Nebamon,
what a treat for thine eyes!”</p>

<p>Hardly waiting for the unfortunate Hittite
youth to gather himself together, Baltu, trembling
with excitement and cupidity, led his two
victims to the long cedar gangplank. Once on
shore he pushed aside the sweating carriers, and
pulling along his two charges with him, started
off down the street.</p>

<p>Presently they passed the common slaver’s
block. Two brilliantly painted booths were at
the moment in use. Upon one stood a stolid
Nubian woman and two weeping children; upon
the other a troop of half-starved Amu, whom
the priests of Karnak, their original owners,
were now selling.</p>

<p>Baltu’s great fist thundered at the door of
the last house southward along the waterfront.
He slid back the bolt and threw open the door,
waving his two charges into a narrow corridor.
In a stentorian voice he shouted a command or
greeting to the unseen inhabitants of the dwelling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
and stalked off down the corridor, and then
up a short flight of stairs to a room in the
harem or second story.</p>

<p>This room turned a blank wall to the river
front—as indeed did all three stories of the
house—but it overlooked a broad and well-kept
garden. Its painted cedar door gave upon an
awning-covered balcony which immediately
overlooked the customary lotus-pool. A giant
sycamore spread its shady branches far and
wide above the flower-dotted water.</p>

<p>In the shade of this aged tree Baltu’s Egyptian
wife, an enormously fat but strikingly
handsome Theban, was taking a short walk supported
on the arms of two Nubian women. Her
pet gosling rested upon her capacious bosom.</p>

<p>At the sudden appearance of their lord and
master the latter dropped Bentamen’s arms
and commenced dancing, clapping their hands,
and sending out upon the quiet morning air the
shrill “welcome cry” of their race, in which the
beaming Bentamen, Baltu’s spouse, attempted
to join. Tears of joy the while dropped in a
shower upon the head of her devoted pet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>However, Baltu had no time for greetings.
In response to his directions Bentamen, supported
by her maids, waddled slowly toward a
little kiosk in the rear of the garden, a summer
house almost buried in a circle of ragged date
and dôm palm. Though in his rough way, Baltu
devotedly loved his fat wife, business always
consigned her to second place in her lord’s
heart.</p>

<p>During this little scene Bhanar had had time
to gaze about her. The room in which they
stood was decorated with painted designs of
hunting scenes, boomerang-hunting amidst the
marshes, a common pastime with the wealthier
Egyptians. The ceiling decoration consisted of
a painted band of spiral grape vines, whose
dainty tendrils met and intertwined immediately
above her head.</p>

<p>In one corner the artist had introduced a cat
crouching to spring upon an unsuspecting field
mouse. The latter was busily engaged in eating
its way into a fat bunch of luscious purple
grapes.</p>

<p>Puns being the Egyptian’s stock in trade, his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
common form of wit, the artist had scrawled in
minute hieroglyphics below: “Oh, guest, whosoever
thou art, what do you think of this for a
vignette?”</p>

<p>Bhanar, it is true, could not read the inscription,
but she could appreciate the charm of the
little apartment, its brilliant frescoes and its
floors powdered with finest white sand, gold
dust, lapis lazuli and turquoise.</p>

<p>A scent as of some sweet pungent incense
floated in the air. Scented woods from the Incense
Country had been stocked in the center of
the little brazier which glowed fitfully at the
edge of a low dais hung with richly embroidered
linen.</p>

<p>This dais stood well back against the eastern
wall of the room. Upon it stood a light wicker-work
couch, its head and back of ebony, its four
high feet of ivory carved to represent panther’s
claws.</p>

<p>Clapping his hands, Baltu gave certain sharp
directions to an obsequious Nubian, who appeared
as if by magic at his summons. Thereafter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
Baltu smiled, stroked his long beard and,
taking a small bottle of wine from a niche in
the wall, shook a few drops into the brazier.
He muttered a prayer to Bar, Baal and Isis as
he poured out the wine. Could his two hearers
have understood his words, they would have
heard the old slaver bribe his gods, foreign and
Egyptian alike, with promises of rich libations,
of oxen and geese, should his bait be taken at
the figure he had fixed.</p>

<p>Baltu in this, did but follow the lead of
Pharaoh himself, though Pharaoh, god incarnate,
had he but paused to consider it, did but
seek to bribe himself, in the person of his celestial
counterpart.</p>

<p>Word soon spread through the mart that
Baltu the Phoenician was selling, and Baltu
was known as a merchant who sold nothing but
the best and rarest, whether that best consisted
of spices, perfumes, wines, jewels, Babylonian
glass or slaves.</p>

<p>Baltu the Phoenician lifted a jeweled hand:
“Listen, Thebans! Four months have passed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
since I have gazed upon the Queen of Cities,
Thebes the Glorious! During these four months
I have visited Meggido, Charchemish, Tyre and
Askelon. My last voyage hither brought ye true
lazuli of Babylon, and precious incense from
the Incense Land, the waterless land of the
East!</p>

<p>“This time we bring ye amethysts and turquoise
for your beads and bangles, malachite
for the healing of your eyes, incense for your
nostrils, precious oils for your anointing, or to
mix with those ceremonial cones that custom
bids ye place upon your graceful wigs, also”—suddenly
his eyes catch the sight of the one man
above all others he wished to see. He broke off
and addressed the newcomer directly. “For
thee, my lord Nebamon, a rose; nay, a human
rose, softly pink as a rose of Naharin! Step up,
great lord, <em>see for thyself</em>!” With a quick
movement Baltu unloosed the gold girdle that
supported the heavy robe so gracefully draped
about the shrinking Bhanar.</p>

<p>“A rose indeed, Nebamon? Do my lord’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
lists boast a form more perfect, a skin more
lustrous, hair so long, so like the ruddy gold of
Nubia? Should not this damsel, this daughter
of a long line of kings, be added to the royal
lists? Were the great noble Menna, son of
Menna, here now, would he not straightway buy
the maiden? Never shall I be content until I
see thee take from thy finger the seal that adds
this wondrous creature to thy villa yonder.”</p>

<p>Nebamon, typical eunuch and slave-dealer,
handsome of face, obese to such an extent that
the skin of his torso lay over his jeweled girdle
in thick folds, Nebamon nodded his head as his
great velvet eyes slowly appraised the many
charms of the crouching maiden.</p>

<p>“Thy price, Baltu? And mark thee well!
Should she turn out the shrew that fair-skinned
Hittite Gadiya proved to be, she shall be returned,
or never again will Baltu’s galley pass
the northern frontier into Egypt! May the
Hound eat her, she is still upon my hands, and
like to be!”</p>

<p>“Great lord! Could I know the Hittite for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
shrew. Remember, more than three months I
had her on my book. With me, as with Darman,
she was a very dove, as soft and cooing as the
sacred doves of Hathor’s temple yonder! Nay,
have done with Gadiya; we will speak of her
anon. Thou wouldst know the price of Bhanar
the Beautiful, of Bhanar—a daughter of Kings?
There are perhaps four whose names allow
the purchase of the maid, and these be Pharaoh
himself, Rames, your good Vizier, Menna, the
King’s Overseer, and, perhaps, thyself! One
thousand gold <i>uten</i> and five hundred bags of
northern wheat will buy the maid, Nebamon!
Make up thy mind, and quickly. Yonder I see
approaching the carrying chair of thy most
dreaded rival, Menna, son of Menna. What says
my lord Nebamon?”</p>

<p>“Five hundred <i>uten</i>, Baltu; all I have is thine
for the maid!” The handsome noble shot a
hasty glance in the direction of the oncoming
chair of Menna, the King’s Overseer. It was
plainly visible to all present, as it swung up the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
garden path, two outrunners with slaves going
before, a foreign conceit which Menna had imported
from Naharin.</p>

<p>Nebamon drew from his jeweled girdle his
writing set. He affected to write out a memorandum.</p>

<p>“One thousand <i>uten</i> and five hundred bags of
wheat will buy the maid, Nebamon, nothing
less.”</p>

<p>Arriving just in time to hear the repetition of
the price Menna descended from his chair,
crossed the room and stood before the shrinking
Bhanar. Menna never haggled. He bought
outright or he signaled his bearers and was
borne away without a word.</p>

<p>On this occasion Menna took a hasty look at
Bhanar, turned to Baltu and cried: “Done, the
girl is mine!”</p>

<p>With a scowl upon his handsome face Nebamon
haughtily withdrew, followed by a half
score of excited Theban nobles and the usual
group of hangers on, those “flies on meat” who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
customarily attached themselves to the more
reckless nobles of the resident city.</p>

<p>Within the hour the delighted Bhanar found
herself attached as maid to the person of the
Princess Sesen, attendant of Noferith, the
young Queen. All her fears in this direction
were instantly dispelled when the Princess advised
her of her simple duties in Syrian as pure
as her own. From that hour Bhanar adored the
very ground her beautiful mistress walked on.
From that day Bhanar became the very shadow
of the little Princess.</p>

<p>The secret of Bhanar’s present good fortune
was due to the fact that Menna, son of Menna,
loved the Princess Sesen. Menna felt that such
a gift as that of the beautiful slave-girl would
go far to impress the haughty little maiden with
the sincerity of his suit. Possibly this lavish
expenditure would touch her hard little heart.</p>

<p>The price was indeed a high one, even for a
Royal Overseer. But it was the first time in all
Menna’s thirty-odd years that a woman had not
smiled upon his suit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>Stranger still, perhaps, for the first time,
Menna truly loved a woman. True, Menna’s
love by now was closely akin to madness, since
the little maid continually frowned upon his suit.
The youthful general, Ramses, he knew, was
ever in her thoughts.</p>

<p>Yet, Menna never despaired. In earlier years
he had often been on the point of relinquishing
some tirelessly pursued quarry, of a similarly
serenely unruffled type, when lo, the pomegranate
had suddenly fallen into his hands.</p>

<p>But what of Renny, Bhanar’s would-be rescuer?
Returning overjoyed from his visit to
Yakab, the Chancellor, Renny had reached the
acacia grove fronting Thethi’s Tavern when
something suddenly descended upon his head
and the last thing he remembered was a stunning
blow and then—oblivion.</p>

<p>Could Renny the Syrian but have had some
slight premonition of what next would happen
to his poor unconscious body, he would certainly
have rubbed that small green crocodile pendant
at his neck, the gift of an Egyptian friend, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
uttered the formula which drives that voracious
creature from its prey.</p>

<p>But Renny was a Syrian. He wore that little
green charm merely to please his friend. Renny
put no trust in feathers of ibis or blood of
lizard; he smiled at charms and magic incantations.
Renny’s own simple religion was a religion
of love, not of fear.</p>

<p>Yet, who knows, perhaps the little charm was
to assist him, and this in spite of himself.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII<br />
<span class="smcap smaller">How Renny the Syrian Escaped the Crocodiles</span></h2>

<p class="dropcap">We have already alluded to the violent
sandstorm which had raged over Thebes.
As Kham-hat had truthfully said, such a
storm had not been known since that memorable
day when Thi the Beautiful, had been brought
up-river to Egypt’s capital, there to become the
favorite wife of the late Pharaoh.</p>

<p>The storm had been especially severe in the
immediate vicinity of the capital, or so at least,
it had seemed to the disgusted Thebans. Their
loud complaints as to the hideous damage done
were not unduly emphasized, since the baleful
effects of this storm, both in and about the resident
city, were apparent on every hand.</p>

<p>Many of the famous palms and giant sycamores
in Pharaoh’s palace garden had been uprooted
or despoiled of their finest branches.
Many of the Abyssinian trees and Lebanus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
cedars, that lined the causeway leading to Hatshepsut’s
ivory-toned chapel, now lay prone
across its well-paved incline, or, loosened at the
roots, hung shriveled, torn and dejected, far out
across its brightly painted parapets.</p>

<p>Dust, a foot or more in depth, had drifted
against the gates of the villas, many of which
seemed as if they might rather have opened
upon some gloomy mortuary-garden than upon
the dainty gardens of exalted nobles, with their
wealth of tamarisks, acacias, myrrh, sandalwood
and stately Lebanus cedars.</p>

<p>Not a sign of life was visible along the sloping
walls of the city, not a living thing stirred in its
dark and narrow streets. Covered by the same
gray pall of dust, Thebes had seemingly united
herself with her immense burial-ground to the
westward. Thebes appeared to have become
one vast city of the dead!</p>

<p>A swirl of the fine impalpable Egyptian dust
rose into the shimmering air, a whirling and
ever-widening cone—part sand, part river-silt,
part <em>human</em> ashes. Yes, throughout the Nile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
Valley, an Egyptian might be said to breathe
the very ashes of his ancestors.</p>

<p>Suddenly the sun leaped above the Eastern
Hills. The city awoke. Smoke rose upon the
heavy morning air and drifted slowly, like a
blue-gray streamer, up the curving shores of
the Theban Valley.</p>

<p>Kathi, the embalmer, on his way to the landing
stage leading to the Temple of Karnak,
paused to watch the maneuvers of the war-vessels,
as they sought their berths along the
western bank.</p>

<p>At this moment, one vessel’s huge square sail,
a picturesque checker-board of green and white,
flapped madly, as its head flew up suddenly in
the wind. It seemed that Duādmochef, the
Wind-god, was not to be cheated out of a few
parting puffs from his lusty lungs!</p>

<p>The look-out-man, standing in the prow, pole
in hand, shouted a hasty warning to the captain
aft, but, before his raucous order could be
understood, the heavy boat had buried its nose,
with the ghastly trophies it bore, deep in a hidden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
sand-bar. For a time it seemed that the
stiffly swaying forms of the wretched foreign
chieftains lashed to the prow would break the
thongs which held them in place. It availed
nothing that Ranuf, the captain, cursed the look-out-man,
his father and his forebears since
Egypt emerged from the primordial <i>Nu</i>! And
the unhappy Ameni suffered the irate captain’s
curses in silence, as it was the sixth mishap of
the kind since leaving the sandstone quays of
Enet, sacred to the Goddess Hathor.</p>

<p>As Ranuf hurled at the bent head of his look-out-man
a last fearful <i>hekau</i>, a potent spell
intended to consign the soul of his discomfited
assistant to the voracious maw of Osiris’s
hound, he noticed a dark patch floating upon
the water below. A white face gazed up into
his:</p>

<p>“Abdi, quick! A drowning man; a countryman
of thine; if I mistake not.”</p>

<p>The Syrian addressed strode quickly to the
captain’s side, took one look at the slowly drifting
body and, casting aside his sandals and
loin-cloth, disappeared headlong into the river.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
Cautiously the captain extended a long pole in
the direction of the swimming sailor. In another
moment, Abdi was drawn safely to the
deck, and, with him, the apparently lifeless
figure of the man he had attempted to save.</p>

<p>Abdi rose to his feet, seemingly none the
worse for his adventure. He clasped the captain’s
hand: “Adon! I thought a devil had me
by the heels! Truly the eddies hereabouts have
a deadly grip! Dost know the lad? A fellow
countryman by those blue eyes of his! See, they
open! Breath of Adon, ’tis an ugly crack he
hath! Cut the thongs that bind him! Verily,
’tis dangerous work to meddle with Syrians, as
they who planned this treacherous attack will
find, should Thi get wind of it! Thou knowest in
such a case, even the ‘tried, judged, found his
bitter doom!’ is omitted from the records, since
‘thus we save the government’s ink,’ says that
wag Thethi!”</p>

<p>The captain bent over the still motionless
form of the unknown. He tried to recall the
face but failed.</p>

<p>At this moment the Syrian presented a most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
woeful appearance. The long, slim form lay
inert; the eyes from time to time opened and
closed wearily. Blood still trickled slowly from
a slight cut along one side of his forehead.</p>

<p>By now he was surrounded by half a score of
curious, yet sympathetic sailors. One bound up
his wound, another provided him with a striped
headcloth, another placed a dry robe about his
shoulders.</p>

<p>As he once more fluttered back to consciousness,
a sailor addressed him in the Egyptian
tongue:</p>

<p>“Stranger, how comest thou in such a strait?
Verily had it not been for that patch of reeds,
the crocodiles that swarm about the temple quay
had sighted thy bobbing form, or the gripping
whirlpools around the Southern Bend had
drawn thee to the river’s slimiest depths?
Breath of Sebek! Thy pendant did indeed protect
thee!”</p>

<p>The question was understood, as was evident
from the color that rushed to the pale face, and
the intelligence that lit up the bright blue eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>No doubt the question recalled to the Syrian’s
brain the memory of the attack which had so
nearly cost him his life. He struggled to his
feet. A draught of wine, and, in a few moments,
he seemed little the worse for his experience.</p>

<p>“Friends, ’tis a tale of jealousy. I am named
Renny, a Syrian, a sculptor attached to the
house of the Lord Menna, son of Menna, Overseer
of Pharaoh (health to him). I know not
who hath planned this murderous attack upon
me. No enemies have I to my knowledge.”</p>

<p>He turned to Abdi: “Fellow countryman, I
thank thee that thou dids’t so opportunely go to
my rescue. May this bar requite thee!” Renny
slipped from his arm a broad band of gold and
handed it to Abdi.</p>

<p>Whether the excitement of the rescue and
rush of all hands to the side had had anything
to do with it or not no one could say, but at this
moment the clumsy barge suddenly yielded
itself to the renewed efforts of the chanting
polers, and swung around into mid-stream.</p>

<p>As it drew alongside the western landing-stage,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
Renny leaped ashore. With a wave of the
hand to his rescuers, he abruptly disappeared
among the bales of hides and serried ranks of
great empty water jars, which were piled up
high along the shore, awaiting shipment to the
north.</p>

<p>Renny had seen a company of Royal Guardsmen
drawn up before the colonnaded portico of
the royal landing-stage.</p>

<p>He had nothing to fear from the soldiers.
These, he well knew, waited to escort the victorious
General Ramses into Pharaoh’s presence.</p>

<p>Yet, at their head, idly swinging a jeweled
scarab which hung upon a long gold chain, stood
Bar, a spy in the service of Menna, the King’s
Overseer, Renny’s powerful patron.</p>

<p>Renny had his reasons for seeking to avoid
the Prince’s servant at this juncture. He could
not shake off the feeling that Bar, the spy, was
concerned, in some way, with the attack that
had so nearly cost him his life.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII<br />
<span class="smcap smaller">Nōfert-āri Dances Before Pharaoh</span></h2>

<p class="dropcap">In chariots or carrying-chairs members of the
Court were hurrying to the Palace, to assist
at the feast planned to honor, at one and
the same time, Belur, the newly arrived Hittite
Ambassador, and the victorious Egyptian general,
Ramses, but now returned from Nubia.</p>

<p>According to precedent Ramses would present
himself before Pharaoh and the Court
in order to receive the customary favors bestowed
upon a victorious Egyptian leader, those
“favors which the King bestows” and “the
gold order of valor.”</p>

<p>Throughout the long day the excitable Theban
populace had yelled itself hoarse, as one after
another the war-barges swung around the great
bend of the river, south of Thebes.</p>

<p>Each boat was marked by its standard-of-cognizance,
and no sooner was its mooring-stake<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
driven into the bank than a yelling, gesticulating
and joyfully-weeping hoard of relatives
and friends of the crew burst upon its
decks.</p>

<p>From that moment, all signs of discipline
utterly vanished. Men, women and children entered
upon one of those inevitable carouses
which, in Egypt, ever followed such a home-coming.</p>

<p>Everyone was coming up to Thebes in order
to witness the great celebration in honor of victory.
It being festival time even the indigent
passengers at the western bank were to-day
allowed to work their way across the river by
bailing the leaky ferryboats.</p>

<p>Thi, the Queen-Mother, in company with the
weak but pretty young queen, left the Women’s
Apartments early, on her way to the Banquet-hall.
As she passed the various courts and
columned porticos the watchful eunuchs, guards
and servants, hurled themselves prostrate at
sight of her. On knees and elbows they groveled,
prayers for “health” and “long life”
upon their trembling lips.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>To the dreaded Thi, as to Pharaoh himself,
honors were rendered as to the gods.</p>

<p>And she whom Egypt feared, and Enana the
Magician dared; she who had been called by her
friends Thi the Beautiful, by her enemies Thi
the Foreigner, Thi the Commoner, how shall we
best describe her?</p>

<p>The Queen-Mother’s head was small, her low
forehead slightly retreated. Her nose was of
the delicate Syrian type, the tip somewhat
rounded, the nostrils well opened. From beneath
artificially prolonged eyebrows, eyebrows
shaved close and lightly penciled with black
antimony paste, glowed two large and lustrous
eyes. Thi’s lips were full, but well-cut. Cruelty
showed in the drooping corners.</p>

<p>At this moment Thi was clad in one of the
richest costumes of the extravagant New Empire,
a pale-green robe minutely plaited and
studded at intervals with lotus-flowers in beaten
gold. Gold plumes, which rose above a gem-encrusted
headdress of vulture form, seemed
to give height and dignity to one who was in
reality a short and slender woman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>About the great Queen’s throat, wrist and
ankles were broad bands of alternate gold bars
and minute cylinders of beryl and amethyst.
The names of Aton, the Syrian sun-god,
stamped in rich blue fayence, hung from a long
chain well down upon her high bosom.</p>

<p>Though now no longer in the dazzling beauty
of her youth, Thi still possessed many a charm
of face and form. Yet, had she been devoid of
such, her voice had served to win for her the
great and powerful empire that was hers. At
the sound of it, one knew at once why in Akhmin,
where first her parents had settled, men
had called her Nightingale; why, at a later date,
poets and singers of the Theban court had vied
with one another to do her honor.</p>

<p>No mere doll-faced beauty had caused the
former monarch to set aside Queen Hanit, an
exalted lady of the line of Egypt’s royal house
and a lineal descendant of Ra the sun-god, yes,
and to cause the death of the unhappy Prince
Wazmes whom she had borne him.</p>

<p>Thi’s face and form had been enough to set
kings and princes warring. Yet, to those prized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
gifts of Hathor, Beauty’s Goddess, had Ptah of
Memphis added the voice of a ten-stringed lute,
and Khnum, Fashioner of Mankind, an intellect
that had quickly won to her by far the greater
number of the nobles of the court.</p>

<p>Thus had Thi, a foreigner, a woman sprung,
by descent at least, from common Syrian stock,
usurped the rightful place of the great Queen
Hanit, descendant of kings and a king’s wife.</p>

<p>At the foot of a short flight of steps leading to
the festival hall, Thi and Menna met. They exchanged
the customary string of effusive greetings
and honorifics.</p>

<p>As the Queen-Mother swept on she found her
way blocked by the crooked form of Enana.
The wizened old Magician stood leaning upon
his jackal-headed staff immediately in the center
of the narrow passage.</p>

<p>Enana’s sole garment consisted of a long kilt
or tunic fastened at the waist by a jeweled belt,
and faced in front with squares of fine gold.
This was an affectation of a fashion long since
forgotten.</p>

<p>At Thi’s cold greeting the puckered and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
heavily-lined face of this animated mummy
trembled with what might equally well have
answered for a smile or a grimace. Yet, beneath
his shaven eyebrows, his half-veiled eyes
glittered ominously, as they lifted for a second
to those of the frowning queen. Enana ignored
her greeting.</p>

<p>Involuntarily Thi shuddered, yet inwardly
cursed herself for a fool. It was only Enana, a
fellow who lived, nay, had lived for centuries,
’twas said, upon the credulity and superstition
of the Thebans!</p>

<p>Thi swept past him and out upon the balcony
overlooking the long hall. There she found
Noferith, her son’s wife, the Princess Sesen,
and others of the maids of honor, awaiting her.</p>

<p>As Thi seated herself, Menna passed below
her balcony. He bowed to the two queens, yet
his eyes sought those of the Princess Sesen.</p>

<p>Menna, the King’s Overseer, had again
yielded himself to the spell of a pair of lustrous
eyes and dimpled cheeks. He loved the little
Princess, as he had never loved before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>For the past few weeks, Menna had wooed
the Princess assiduously. Thi, the Queen-Mother,
for reasons of her own, had sought to
aid him in his suit.</p>

<p>All in vain.</p>

<p>The little Princess would have none of him.
Thi knew well, as in fact did Menna, that Sesen’s
heart was filled with thoughts of Ramses, with
hopes of his speedy return. Menna’s servant,
Bar, called by many “Menna’s shadow,” as lean
and hungry looking as a neglected <i>ka</i>, sought to
convince his master that her indifference was
due to a present lover, some favorite among the
courtiers. Menna knew better, yet affected to
believe him. Meanwhile, unused to failure in
such enterprises, he continued to besiege the
Princess with well-turned couplets, rich and
ever-varied presents, and courtly flatteries.</p>

<p>At this moment, his restless black eyes sought
to attract those of the all-unconscious object of
his affections. His glance dwelt with delight
upon her spotless white gala robes. He noted
the graceful wig confined by a rose-colored fillet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
from which drooped fragrant white lotus-flowers;
the huge circular gold earrings, and
the flashing pectoral ornament—a glitter of
jeweled inlays—which rose and fell at every
breath.</p>

<p>Sesen’s cheeks and lips were artificially reddened,
her eyebrows shaved and lightly penciled
with kohl, like those of the Queen and Queen-Mother.
Yet, unlike them, her tongue was
silent, her smiles had vanished. Sesen’s somber
eyes evinced little interest in the bustle and joyful
preparations about her. Twice did Noferith
the Queen touch her with the dainty little scent-tube
she carried, in an effort to recall her to her
laughter-loving self.</p>

<p>Finally, after the sweet-scented lotus which
each lady carried had been changed but once,
the Princess Sesen rose, pleading faintness.
The sympathetic Queen whom she served, allowed
her to retire without exacting the formal
prostration.</p>

<p>At her withdrawal Menna’s disappointment
was intense. He sank back deep into his painted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
cedar chair. For Menna the feast was at an
end.</p>

<p>But not for the noisy revelers about him.
Even the haughty members of the Hittite ambassador’s
suite forgot for a moment their lofty
attitude of detachment.</p>

<p>For the corpulent Mentu, son of the Vizier
Kena, had whetted the appetites of these
Asiatics. Through the somewhat hesitating
medium of a sibilant Canaanitic dialect, the garrulous
Mentu had somehow managed to make
them understand that the entire kitchen forces
of the governor of Thinis and of Hotepra,
Prince of On, had been brought upstream to assist
the royal cooks.</p>

<p>“Indeed,” said Mentu, “though whirling
sandstorms bury us; though drought and pestilence
stalk the blistered banks of Hapi, yet
shall we enjoy the choicest viands, the rarest
wines,” he clicked his purple tongue; “wines
whose seals have stood intact since good King
Ahmes’ time! But, wait until thou seest
Nōfert-āri! Breath of Ra! Then shalt thou say,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
‘Baal forgive me! Our country is afar off!
Between us lies the raging sea! Egypt is a land
of pleasure and delight! Here let us tarry!’”</p>

<p>And so it proved. For marvel followed marvel
with almost bewildering rapidity.</p>

<p>A dish that won the plaudits of all was an
enormous platter of Syrian craftsmanship.
Upon this gold dish, in the midst of gold reeds
and papyrus, swam ducks, plover, and other
aquatic birds. In a miniature skiff, a diminutive
Egyptian boatman propelled his silver
craft over perfumed water. An Egyptian noble,
standing upright in the bow, aimed a jeweled
throw-stick at a flock of egrets which, with
wings outspread, quivered upon gold wires high
above a thicket of feathery papyrus.</p>

<p>The realistic little figures were of pastry, the
birds cooked with all their feathers on!</p>

<p>Dishes of this sort were countless in number,
the design of the last more astonishing than that
of the first, since each jealous cook had sought
to outshine his rival, both in originality of design
and richness of material.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>But now, at a signal from Pennūt the Usher,
Pharaoh rose from the throne and advanced to
the edge of the dais. To his feet the Usher led
the youthful Ramses.</p>

<p>And there, to the accompaniment of a deepening
roar of applause from the onlookers, Pharaoh
slipped about his victorious general’s neck
that coveted distinction of the Egyptian military,
the necklace of gold lions and flies.</p>

<p>In a brief lull the words of Pharaoh echoed
through the resplendent hall:</p>

<p>“Welcome, thrice welcome, Ramses! Let the
praises of thy lord expand thy heart! Mei has
recounted the story of thy skill and energy in
the conducting of this most bitterly fought campaign.
Where now are the chieftains of Nubia?
They have been ground down as the seed of the
date beneath the crusher, as eye-paint upon the
palette. Yea, they have become as grain which
the mill has crushed! Now are the chieftains of
Wawat forced to sulk in the caves of the hyena.
As a fly hast thou worried them, as a lion hast
thou destroyed them! We place these precious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
orders about thy throat. From this day thy renown
is fragrant as the perfume of the Incense
Country. Arise! Take thy place beside us
as ‘Fan-bearer-on-the-right-of-Pharaoh, thy
Lord!’”</p>

<p>At his elevation to this coveted position, renewed
applause seemed to shake the painted
roof.</p>

<p>Friends pressed forward to kiss the jeweled
chains and ornaments that had but now left the
hand of the god-king. Some hurled themselves
prostrate before these rewards which only Pharaohs
might bestow.</p>

<p>The King shot a covert glance in the direction
of the Balcony reserved for the royal harem.
The Queen-Mother shook her jeweled <i>menat</i> in
company with the other ladies. Yet, in Thi’s
case, the action represented far more than mere
applause or acclamation.</p>

<p>The tactful Belur, Prince of the Hittites, in
turn, rose and added a few well chosen words of
praise for a difficult task so promptly and bloodlessly
accomplished.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>Pharaoh, watching him from beneath his
richly painted canopy, doubted the sincerity of
the smile that played about the handsome lips of
the Hittite. Again he resolved in his mind the
probable cause of the Hittite’s inopportune
visit.</p>

<p>A space was cleared in the center of the hall.
The tables, still groaning under the burden of
their barely glanced at dainties, disappeared as
if by magic. The well-woven mats and glossy
panther-skins were lifted from the stucco floor,
and out upon the space so made sprang a troupe
of lotus-wreathed girls, naked save for the
beaded cincture of maidenhood which encircled
their slender hips.</p>

<p>Scattering Syrian crocuses and the pure white
petals of the lotus, these coffee-colored little
maids, the very embodiment of childish grace,
pelted one another with the perfumed shower
until their little ankles were well-nigh hidden.</p>

<p>As if this had been a signal, the bright blue
warbonnet of Pharaoh was lifted from his head;
an Asiatic slave-boy bathed the royal fingers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
and Pharaoh, with a nervous twitch to his long,
thin features, leaned back wearily against the
embroidered cushions placed at his back by the
attentive Dedu.</p>

<p>The last scene of what had proved a veritable
feast of marvels was about to commence.</p>

<p>The sudden entrance of the merry little children
had been the prelude to “the King’s
dance.”</p>

<p>This dance was a far different performance
from that series of posturing and tumbling commonly
provided by the acrobats of old.</p>

<p>And it was thought that “the King’s dance”
could only be performed by Nōfert-āri, claimed
as daughter by the blind Tutīya, though known
to the irreverent youth of Thebes as the child
of Hathor, of the Goddess of Beauty, sprung
from the head of Ra.</p>

<p>At one end of the flowery carpet left by the
little children knelt three heavily-cloaked
women. Behind them squatted eight shaven-headed
harpers, clutching to their naked breasts
the gilded frames of their ten-stringed instruments.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
Back of these again were flute-players,
players on the hand drum, players on the ivory
castanets, and a group of men and women whose
duty it was to mark the syncopated time by
clapping their hands, agitating <i>menats</i> of jeweled
beads, or shaking sistra of silver or gold.</p>

<p>Suddenly, like the blood-curdling cry of a
savage desert-dweller, the high-pitched call of
Tutīya thrilled the heated frames of the expectant
onlookers.</p>

<p>Instantly the harpers, in a soft and minor
key, commenced an air at once slow in measure,
plaintive and sad, an air that sounded distant
amid the confused murmur of a thousand voices,
the clatter of dishes and the distant tap-tap of
the butlers’ hurrying sandals.</p>

<p>The shrill cry of Tutīya had brought two of
the three women to their feet. Dropping the
cloaks that had enveloped them, they took their
places at some distance in front of the third
figure.</p>

<p>Turning toward the royal dais the two
dancers sank down in a slowly executed courtesy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
until the nodding lotus-flowers that
wreathed their curling wigs swept the flower-strewn
floor below him.</p>

<p>Then, in answer to Pharaoh’s scarcely perceptible
acknowledgment, slowly they rose upon
their slender feet and, with a “life and health,
lords” placed themselves once more beside the
still motionless central figure.</p>

<p>All eyes were centered upon this well-cloaked
figure. It, too, now rose.</p>

<p>Was it motionless? It called to mind the
birth of some glorious butterfly or moth.
The undulating movement that one sees in the
soon to be discarded shell best described the
bursting of Nōfert-āri upon the delighted vision
of her audience as, shivering with the peculiar
motion seen but in those creatures of a day, she
suddenly dropped the dull-brown cloak that enveloped
her, and appeared fresh and smiling to
their view.</p>

<p>In the dancer Nōfert-āri we see a slim, though
willowy form, a form and countenance that represented
the very arch-type of all that an Egyptian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
held beautiful in women. A pair of sparkling
eyes, elongated, obliquely set, gleamed in
frames of blue-black antimony, which served to
accentuate the striking whiteness in which swam
their fathomless pupils.</p>

<p>On Nōfert-āri’s head was set a dark brown wig
which, covered thickly as it was with a myriad
little knots and curls, dropped in well-regulated
layers until it grazed the tips of her thin and
high-set shoulders. This dainty perruque,
fringing with its line of dancing curls a forehead
that rivaled polished jasper, and touching
as it did at every move and gesture the outer
pencilings of her shaven and thickly kohl-stained
eyebrows, seemed to soften the rather
prominent cheekbones and perhaps too pointed
chin. The quiver of her wide though delicate
nostrils, bespoke a passionate nature, which the
faintest of dimples and the ivory flash of small
though regular teeth, did their best to contradict.
The dancer’s full round throat, her arms,
wrists, and well-formed bust, were ablaze with
jewels, amid which pale green beryl, dew-like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
crystal, rose carnelian, gold, electrum and silver,
gleamed in opulent splendor, as her bosom
rose and fell.</p>

<p>As she stood, a pale blue lotus drooping above
each hidden ear, a jeweled <i>menat</i> in one hand,
her coffee-colored and well oiled skin agleam
with the reflected light of innumerable prismatic
colors, she seemed less an animated human form
than a figure carved, by Ptah the god of sculptors
himself, from a block of glowing opal.</p>

<p>With her first perceptible motions the music
rose to the major key. The time-beaters accentuated
the broken rhythm more and more,
while Tutīya, her heavy though sightless eyes
glowing in their painted depths—she too had
once been hailed a Theban favorite—burst ever
and anon into the “Nubian cry,” that blood-stirring
cry which acted as an incentive to her
now posturing daughter.</p>

<p>In the center of the flowery carpet stood
Nōfert-āri, languidly shaking her jeweled <i>menat</i>.
Slowly she turned upon herself, the muscles of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
her lithe little body seeming to quiver in measure
with the vibrant thrumming of the many
stringed harps.</p>

<p>When again she faced the Egyptian monarch’s
dais, unlike the impassive gaze of Pharaoh,
her features seemed to have become transformed.
The “King’s dance,” into which she
now threw all her fascination, all her mesmeric
charm and unrivaled ability, portrayed by
movement of the body and gesture alone the
meeting and stolen tryst of a pair of lovers.</p>

<p>At first she affected the love-smitten beauty,
a coy beauty, mindful of her many charms.</p>

<p>Suddenly with a start, a pigeon-like coo of
delight, she appeared to throw herself into her
lover’s arms.</p>

<p>Again, with all the abandon of an artless
coquetry, she stretched out her long arms and
supple fingered hands as if to push him from
her.</p>

<p>Finally, with one or two graceful little steps,
accompanied by an arch glance over her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
shoulder, Nōfert-āri advanced to the very edge
of the royal dais and commenced that portion of
the dance for which she was so famed.</p>

<p>Into this every muscle of her supple body was
forced to move in unison or singly as she willed.
Her lustrous eyes gleamed beneath their darkened
eyebrows, her expanded nostrils quivered,
her full vermilioned lips were parted, the very
veins in her forehead throbbed in measure with
the refrain. As her supple arms, wrists, and
hands played about her body with a wavelike—an
indescribable motion—her jeweled bust and
firm, yet flexible hips, swayed to the spasmodic
movements natural to the dance.</p>

<p>The music ever increased in volume and, as
if to add contrast to the grace and beauty of
the peerless dancer, a hideous naked pigmy,
beating a tiny onoga-skin drum, leaped out upon
the floor beside her, and grotesquely imitated
her every move and gesture.</p>

<p>Thus, to a chorus of wild staccato yells from
Tutīya and the excited time-beaters, Nōfert-āri,
her form seeming to undulate in fierce spasmodic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
waves from breast to hip, with arms
thrown high above her head, fingers clenched
and eyes fast closed, sank slowly to the stucco
floor.</p>

<p>Presently, as she rose, still trembling, and
while the echoes of that clamorous applause still
reverberated amid the flaring lotus-capitals, a
royal usher hurried to her side, and in the name
of Pharaoh, presented her with a blue fayence
goblet of lotiform design. Inlaid in green,
white and red about the foot was an inscription
revealing her euphonious and happily—chosen
name, Nōfert-āri, “She who is made of beauty.”</p>

<p>Following the dance, Pharaoh had retired
within himself. He had assumed an air of
studied abstraction and aloofness.</p>

<p>Yet, Dedu remarked signs of nervousness in
the twitching of the jaw. Dedu had been born
in the palace, in the self-same year as his exalted
master. Dedu might well have been
called, as indeed at times he was, his master’s
“double,” his other self.</p>

<p>In Pharaoh’s slightly twitching hands and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
the covert glances which from time to time he
directed toward the haughty leader of the
Hittites, Dedu spelled expectancy and, withal,
a nameless fear.</p>

<p>Then it was the Hittite, not Enana the Magician,
his royal master feared! Dedu knew
there had been much speculation as to the true
meaning of Belur’s sudden and quite unexpected
visit to the Egyptian capital.</p>

<p>So far, oriental courtesy—coupled with the
Egyptian’s inherent regard for the rights of
hospitality—had forbidden any outward evidences
of impatience on the part of Pharaoh
or his august Mother.</p>

<p>And Pharaoh did well to distrust the wily
Hittite. With the pause that had followed the
withdrawal of Nōfert-āri and her assistants, the
Asiatic prince rose to his feet, slowly lifting his
jeweled hand to command attention. His keen
glance swept the heads of the swaying crowd
which craned its neck the better to see him and
to hear his words.</p>

<p>The Prince of Charchemish bowed to Pharaoh.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
Slowly he arranged the sash which
served to hold in place his fringed robes and
the little ivory-handled dagger which rested in
its folds.</p>

<p>Silence fell upon the noisy revelers, an
ominous silence. It seemed as if Pharaoh’s nervousness
had somehow mysteriously communicated
itself to the various groups of Egyptian
nobles gathered about him.</p>

<p>Belur the Hittite began to speak. He dwelt
at length upon the many occasions during which
Egyptian ships had brought grain and other
food to famine-stricken Asia. He thanked Great
Pharaoh for his present hospitality and the
courteous consideration which had been shown
him since first he landed upon the fertile soil of
Egypt. He dwelt upon the power for good
exerted by Egypt, not only in Asia, but among
the savage tribes of Nubia, as witness the victorious
campaign just brought to a close, and
which they were at that moment celebrating.</p>

<p>Knowing the might of Pharaoh, lord of
Egypt, Rimur, King of Charchemish, his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
brother, had sent him down into Egypt, that he
might effect an alliance with the throne of
Egypt, an alliance which he was sure would
eventually prove of mutual benefit to Thebes
and Charchemish alike.</p>

<p>In token of his fraternal esteem Rimur had
sent to Egypt a full shipload of the treasure of
his country and of the countries adjacent
thereto. Its hold was filled with the gold and
silver vessels of Zahi, with swords and daggers
cunningly damascened with gold, the work of
Megiddan craftsmen. Inlaid corselets were
there, jeweled quivers, gauntlets worked with
gold and silver threads, and shawls for the
ladies of the courts, so finely woven that they
might be passed with ease through Pharaoh’s
golden signet-ring. To the Queen, the Hittite
King had sent a covered carrying-chair, of
stamped leather richly gilded; to the august
Queen-Mother, a golden goblet from the hands
of Ilg of Kadesh; and lastly, to Pharaoh, his
kingly brother, three fully equipped chariots,
together with nine Syrian horses, swifter than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
the north-wind, to draw them! In the name of
King Rimur, his brother, he asked for the hand
of the eldest daughter of Pharaoh his brother,
the Princess Aten-merit, in marriage!</p>

<p>During this speech Pharaoh’s nervous fears
had gradually given place to astonishment and
finally to anger. This new-found arrogance and
assurance among the “little people” was an
entirely new departure.</p>

<p>As he rose to his feet to reply there was a
look upon his face which neither Belur nor his
own courtiers had expected to see. Before that
look even Belur’s assumed effrontery slowly
dissolved.</p>

<p>“Son of Rabatta, it is now less than a year
since a Hittite embassy stood within this very
hall! Like thee, it came freighted With the
rarest and richest products of the Asiatics! If
we remember rightly its offerings included one
hundred logs of Lebanus cedar, five hundred
pounds of Cilician silver, three hundred pounds
of the true lapis-lazuli of Babylon, two hundred
gold and electrum goblets, with choice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
silver vases of the workmanship of Zahi! In
comparison with this, thy meager offerings
seem to prove that Charchemish hath lost its
hold upon the Lebanus, upon the Cilician mines,
upon the princes of Zahi, of Kadesh and
Megiddo? Or perhaps thy brother hath forgotten
the circumstances which prompted his
father’s princely gift! Not with gifts for
favors to be received came Rabatta thy father!
Nay, with <em>tribute</em>, with the tribute of a <em>vassal</em>
did he come! With tribute exacted through fear
of Egypt’s might.</p>

<p>“Take back this message to Rimur thy
brother! Thus saith Pharaoh of Egypt: ‘’Tis
but a breath of time since Rabatta knelt at
Pharaoh’s knee, swearing fealty! Wherefore
hath Rimur, his son, failed to do the like?’</p>

<p>“As to thy insolent proposal, when hath a
Daughter of the Sun left the land of Egypt at
the beck and call of rebel princelings? ’Tis in
our mind to hold thee hostage for thy brother’s
quick return to reason. Yet, go! And with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
thee take thy gifts, fit only to dazzle some savage
Amu!”</p>

<p>At Pharaoh’s words Belur the Hittite took a
step nearer to the royal dais. A covert sneer
played about his well-cut lips, though his eyes
were hard, his cheek pale. Raising his hand
with a gesture almost threatening once again
he addressed the trembling monarch:</p>

<p>“Hear me, Pharaoh! One other word my
august brother sends to Pharaoh, king of
Egypt. The Hittite army is to-day one hundred
thousand strong. The princes of Zahi and
Naharin, the kings of Kadesh, Gezer and Megiddo,
have joined their forces unto his! Of thy
Syrian vassals half have left thee! The Khabiri
are up! Ribaddi alone stands true to thee
and, even he by now doubtless has fed a vulture’s
maw.</p>

<p>“Hearken to the words of Rimur, my brother!
Thy present state is well known to us! Thy
plague-stricken land stands on the brink of a
great religious war! In Nubia to the south, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
in thy Asiatic possessions to the north, thy
vassal-states have risen in revolt against thee!
Nay, Pharaoh, heed the words of Rimur my
brother, or thy Asiatic possessions are lost to
thee! Great Kheta, the combined armies of all
the Asiatic principalities, stand at thy very
gates ready to devour thee! Thus saith Rimur,
Lord of lords, King of kings, Lion that Devoureth
Lions!”</p>

<p>Pharaoh’s face was terrible to see. His jaws
worked, the veins upon his forehead stood out
like knotted ropes, his large eyes flashed with
fires of wrath. He quickly raised his golden
scepter as if he would have felled the audacious
Hittite at his feet. The wand of sard and gold
snapped between his clenched fingers.</p>

<p>Controlling himself by a mighty effort Pharaoh
pointed to the door and somehow managed
to articulate the one word: “Begone!”</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX<br />
<span class="smcap smaller">The Luminous Book</span></h2>

<p class="dropcap">High up among the tombs lived Unis,
neophyte of the Temple of Amen. The
abandoned tomb-chapel which served to
shelter him immediately overlooked the tree-embowered
villa of Enana the Magician, for
whom, at times, the youthful prophet worked.
His only attendant was Bata, an aged Ethiopian,
not so long ago his nurse.</p>

<p>Bata was seen almost daily in the market-place.
Here she not only collected the various
offerings of the simple herdsmen and peasants,
but acted as go-between in the affairs of the
superstitious farmers, herdsmen and petty
officials who were in the habit of consulting her
master. For Unis carried on a desultory practice
in necromancy, astrology and divination.
Bata collected the fees, which were generally
paid in kind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>Unis spent the few “auspicious days” which
the Egyptian calendar allowed to each month,
seated upon a low bench beneath a sycamore
tree on the border of a narrow canal, immediately
opposite Enana’s island home. Here he
listened to those who came to consult him or
wrote letters for those who required it.</p>

<p>In his character of seer, Unis had found it
necessary to act in many varied capacities.
During the course of a single day, he was often
called upon to act as scribe, physician, exorcist,
diviner, faith-healer and farmer.</p>

<p>Unis was supposed to know the past; he could
foretell the future. He could “see” one who
had tampered with his neighbor’s landmarks or
altered the flow of water in his neighbor’s dykes.
He could forewarn of an approaching sandstorm—that
nine days’ terror of the traveler.
He could provide the necessary amulets against
the bite of snake or scorpion. He could tell the
whereabouts of lost cattle or name that man or
woman who had made off with the offerings to
the dead.</p>

<p>Thus, a timid maiden, desirous of a love-charm,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
was advised to drink the ashes of a
lizard dissolved in water and to swallow it, with
a prayer to Hathor, some auspicious evening
when Aah, the silver moon, shone at her
brightest.</p>

<p>Consulted by some young gallant of the city,
on similar, though less wholesome lines, Unis
would draw a circle in the sand. A circle, a gold
bangle! Money can open many a door!</p>

<p>The circle might be readily understood, but
the outline of the jackal above it—death’s emblem,
spiritual and physical—was generally
beyond the young man’s powers of comprehension.</p>

<p>To the aged Teta, desirous of a potion which
would assure to him the wished for one hundred
and ten years, Unis replied: “I see the <i>ba</i>-bird
poised above thy tomb.” Teta was found dead
upon his couch the following morning.</p>

<p>To Benta the ambitious Unis had taught the
value of patience by pointing to Auta hard at
work upon his granite statue of the Princess
Bekit-aton.</p>

<p>Six months of cutting, chiseling, rubbing and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
burnishing had the persevering Auta lavished
upon his masterpiece, and, throughout those
weary months, but three simple implements had
served him for his difficult task—a wooden mallet,
a bronze chisel and a flint burnisher. Apart
from this, sand, water and emery-dust were
Auta’s only helpers.</p>

<p>Though Unis was consulted by peasant and
petty official, peasant and official alike considered
him mad. As such he became a person
to be pitied and cared for, as one afflicted by the
gods, yet one through whom the gods spoke.
Thus, Unis could come and go wheresoever and
whensoever he pleased.</p>

<p>Except for his periodic visits to the sycamore,
Unis was rarely seen. All his time was spent
in the great temple library or amidst the crumbling
shrines and half-choked tombs of the
necropolis.</p>

<p>To the guards of the cemetery he was someone’s
animated <i>ka</i>, a restless ‘soul’ seeking, perhaps,
to identify his ruined tomb or to find and
become reunited to the lost ‘souls’ of his wife
and children. He was constantly on the lips<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
of the public-storytellers as an ever-present
example of the truth of one of the oldest and
most familiar of Egyptian wondertales, the
Adventures of Menti.</p>

<p>In point of fact, Unis was as much flesh and
blood as anyone. Yet none, whether courtier,
priest or peasant, could have guessed the reason
of his tireless researches among the open shafts
and ruined chapels of the older part of the great
Theban cemetery.</p>

<p>However, the very fact that the Thebans were
so frequently regaled with the story of Menti
might well have given them a clue as to the true
reason of Unis’ occupation in that haunted spot.</p>

<p>It seems that Menti’s “spirit” returned from
enjoying a few hours among living men and reentered
his mummy to find that the bodies of
his wife and child were missing from their
coffins. Menti at once compelled their restoration
by means of his knowledge of the names,
charms and talismans contained in the magic
Book of Thoth.</p>

<p>Written, ’twas said, by the God Thoth himself,
this wonder-working Book had once belonged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
to that Architect and Seer of old, Imhotep.
It was a common saying in Unis’ day
that the Great Step Pyramid west of white-walled
Memphis, could never have been raised
had it not been for the compelling incantations—recited
in the prescribed attitude and with the
proper tone of voice—by that now deified architect
of the godkings of old, Imhotep.</p>

<p>Before the death of Imhotep, it was said that
he had hidden the Magic Book behind the sarcophagus
in which lay King Zozer, his master,
deep within his stupendous pyramid. A thousand
years later its hiding place had been revealed
to Amenhotep, son of Hap, in a dream.</p>

<p>Amenhotep’s possession of the Book must
have been a fact. How else could he have
erected the colossal Temple to the “spirit” of
the late Pharaoh; how otherwise could he have
built the Temple at Kha-en-Mat, the beautiful
Temple on the Island and the great colonnaded
Temple of Amen, upon which, at the command
of Pharaoh Akhten-aton, work had but recently
been relinquished.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>Indeed, without Thoth to assist him, who
could have raised the two great statues of the
late Pharaoh, over seven hundred tons in
weight. Who could have lifted above the court
the stupendous architraves of his Mortuary
Temple, two hundred tons of stone, and, finally,
who could have perfected the huge stone tablet,
thirty feet in height, and covered it with gold
and gems? None but the God Thoth, of course!</p>

<p>But, would Thoth willingly stop the Sunboat
and descend to earth merely to raise for men
monuments that should rival the very halls of
the gods themselves?</p>

<p>Not unless compelled thereto by the fact that
his <em>Names</em> were known to mortals, his stolen
<em>Talismans</em> in the possession of some inhabitant
of earth.</p>

<p>One object alone on earth contained those
Hidden Names and Talismans, together with
the “Utterances” which could compel both
Thoth and Set to leave their appointed places
in the sky and descend to earth.</p>

<p>This series of irresistible “incantations,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
these compelling “utterances” which could thus
drag the very gods from heaven, were all contained
in the “Luminous Book of Thoth.”</p>

<p>Herein were inscribed the Hidden Names of
all the Gods, the Triads, the Enneads of the
Sky. Herein were the Mysterious Names of the
Keepers of the Double Gates of Heaven; of the
Serpents that guard the approaches of Duat, of
Ra in his Boat, of Osiris on his Throne!</p>

<p>So awe-inspiring a hold upon the imagination
of the Thebans had the legend of this mysterious
Book that its name was never mentioned.
Rarely, indeed, was it alluded to by the
priests.</p>

<p>Like that of Pharaoh, the sun-god manifest in
the flesh, like that of the Unseen Statue of the
Great Temple of Amen, like that of the abhorred
Crocodile God of Ombos, its name was
never taken upon the lips.</p>

<p>When the architect Amenhotep, son of Hap,
was gathered to his fathers, Pharaoh commanded
that he should be buried beneath a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
little temple which stood somewhat to the south
of his own stupendous mortuary temple.</p>

<p>Here, for a time, Unis had acted as lector,
intoning the prayers and offering to the hidden
<i>ka</i>-statue of the dead architect the various portions
of meat, bread and wine with which Pharaoh
had endowed the tomb, out of taxes
received from the nearby town of Onit. In so
doing, Unis stood immediately above the subterranean
chamber in which the mummy of
Amenhotep lay.</p>

<p>Unis had been called from his duties at the
son of Hap’s tomb by Enana, and set to work
among the ancient manuscripts of the great
library of Amen.</p>

<p>Enana would have him find some clue to the
present whereabouts of the Book of Thoth. As
he loved life and feared death he was told to
keep for his master’s ears alone any news to
this effect.</p>

<p>Unis soon became an initiate of the Sorcerers
of Amen, then minor prophet of Amen. With<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
such a powerful master as Enana, first Magician
of the Temple, Unis felt that he should go
far. He gave himself up wholly to the work in
hand. Certain hints gleaned from the documents
led him to believe that the Book had, as of
old, been secreted in a tomb, in this case an unnamed
tomb on the western shore.</p>

<p>Unis took up his residence in one of the abandoned
tombs. With unremitting assiduity and
stoical fortitude he spent day after day among
the excoriated boulders, the dusty mounds, the
bat-infested shafts and tumbled-in shrines
which constituted the older corner of the Theban
necropolis.</p>

<p>In this fruitless search the Gods Hunger and
Thirst were his only companions.</p>

<p>Unis turned once more to the library. With
indomitable patience he continued his researches
among its unending shelves of musty
documents.</p>

<p>Soon he noticed that the name of Amenhotep,
the son of Hap, was very frequently coupled
with that of the lost Book. In fact, Unis finally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
convinced himself that the Book lay buried with
the body of that old sage, in the subterranean
vault of the little temple at which he had formerly
served.</p>

<p>Armed with permission to spend a night in
the temple, Unis waited until Ahmes, the present
<i>ka</i>-priest, had retired into the outer forecourt,
in an alcove of which he slept. When the
aged priest had snuffed out his lamp, Unis
descended into the vault immediately beneath
the offering-tablet and altar.</p>

<p>With determined perseverance, Unis tapped
walls and floor, slowly, systematically. In the
western corner of the floor his work met with
success. The pavement thereabouts emitted a
hollow sound. In a few moments Unis had lifted
a square slab which fitted so nicely to the floor
that the joints had been invisible. Lamp in
hand, Unis descended a short flight of steps,
picked his way along an uneven rocky passage,
and presently stood in the vaulted tomb-chamber
of the son of Hap.</p>

<p>For an instant unreasoning fear clutched at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
the heart of the reckless priest. There stood
the alabaster sarcophagus which held the body
of the sage. Unis read the inscription engraved
upon the side: “Amenhotep, born of Yatu; his
father Hap, son of Hap, Justified of Osiris.”
There lay Amenhotep and, with him, the Book.</p>

<p>The Book! Unis’ fears vanished. Trembling
with excitement and high hopes the young priest
set himself to his self-imposed task. It was an
auspicious night in the calendar of the prophets
of Amen! The Star of Thoth was in the
ascendent!</p>

<p>Unis set to work with a short, stout bronze
bar. Hour after hour went by unnoted by the
feverishly excited youth.</p>

<p>At last the stone cover yielded to his efforts.
Unis’ eyes gleamed with joy and anticipation.
Enana, his master, would be hailed as one with
Imhotep, builder of the pyramids, with Ptahhotep
the Philosopher, with Amenhotep, son of
Hap, himself! Perhaps he too would compel
the gods to do his bidding!</p>

<p>Unis gave a last push to the great cover. It
fell to the sand-covered floor with a dull thud.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
He lowered the lamp. There before him was
the outer coffin of the old sage. This, in turn,
Unis lifted and found, beneath, the gem-crusted
coffin—solid gold it seemed—in which
Amenhotep’s royal master had caused the son
of Hap to be placed.</p>

<p>The heat in the little chamber was intense.
The blood in Unis’ temples throbbed with his
exertions. His body gleamed in the flickering
light; perspiration ran from every pore. For a
time the youth returned to the upper chamber
where he could fill his lungs with the purer and
cooler air.</p>

<p>But not for long. In a few moments he returned
to the tomb chamber. He lifted the gorgeous
coffin-lid from the linen-swathed form it
concealed. At once the stifling odor of myrrh,
liquidambar, cinnamon, and other strong essences
again almost overcame him.</p>

<p>Unis bent down. With an effort he lifted the
mummified figure. He felt about underneath
the head. Nothing! Unis tried the feet of the
tightly-draped figure. No book!</p>

<p>Then Unis did something for which he knew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
punishment on earth was severe. What might
be his fate in the hereafter Unis did not dare to
think! Lifting the body from the coffin altogether,
he commenced slowly and methodically
to unwrap it. Yard upon yard of aromatic
linens he loosened, until finally nothing but the
blackened form of Amenhotep lay before him.</p>

<p>No eyes had Unis for the jewels with which
Amenhotep’s sorrowing master had covered the
dead architect. The throbbing brain of Unis
was concentrated upon but one thing, the Magic
Book.</p>

<p>It was not in the wrappings. It was not between
the knees of the deceased, where, as Unis
knew, so often documents are placed. It was
not between the folded hands of Amenhotep. It
was neither at his head nor at his feet.</p>

<p>Unis replaced the body in its coffin, throwing
the linens in upon it pellmell. He covered it
with its two wooden covers. The great stone
outer cover he knew must stay where it had
fallen. He could have that replaced by others,
following his report on the present condition of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
the extra wrappings of the son of Hap, which
had been his ostensible reason for entering the
tomb.</p>

<p>Unis once again took mallet in hand. He
carefully and methodically examined both walls
and floor.</p>

<p>He dared not rap upon the False Door.
Behind it slept Amenhotep’s living self, as
represented by his statue.</p>

<p>Unis had far more terror of that enchanted
wooden portrait of the dead man than he had
of the body; the shell, of Amenhotep itself.</p>

<p>Alas, all his efforts were in vain. The Book
of Books was not in the tomb.</p>

<p>Bitterly disappointed, Unis stooped to pick
up his flickering lamp. As he did so his eyes fell
upon a gleaming object which was almost hidden
in the sand at his feet. Mechanically he picked
it up and glanced at the blue and green inlays.
The <i>tat</i>-emblem and solar-disc upon its gold
base showed it to be the scarab-ring of Amenhotep,
son of Hap.</p>

<p>From that date, Unis spent all the daylight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
hours among the tombs of the Theban cemetery.
He systematically covered every foot of the hill-side,
entering both the ancient tombs, and the
modern, as far as he was allowed. At night he
delved among the ancient scrolls of the library
of Amen.</p>

<p>Each night upon his return he had been met
by the impatient Enana. Every night, week in,
week out, he had perforce to shake his head, to
spread his scratched and often bleeding hands
deprecatingly.</p>

<p>Of late Unis’ step had lost its elasticity. An
unnatural brightness glistened in his sunken
eyes. To-night, especially, Enana’s mind had
been filled with anxiety for his safety.</p>

<p>Unis should have rounded the point by the
tamarisk grove hours ago. Enana’s anxiety
was not for Unis. His one thought was of the
Book. The Book he must have, if he would put
his present plans into effect.</p>

<p>Had the young priest but known it, he was
the third person sacrificed by Enana, the Magician,
to the finding of the Book.</p>

<p>As Enana turned to enter the low doorway<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
of the tomb in which Unis had recently taken
up his quarters, an unusual light in the valley
below caught his attention. He paused. At
the foot of the steep incline, at the upper
reaches of which he stood, moved an unnatural
pinkish flame. It seemed to palpitate, to wax
and wane as it moved, for move it did.</p>

<p>Nearer, ever nearer, it came, constantly growing
larger and brighter, until suddenly by its
light Enana recognized the pallid face of Unis,
his assistant.</p>

<p>As Unis came towards him the overjoyed
Enana noticed that his long thin arms were held
straight out before him, that there, upon his upturned
palms lay—the Luminous Book!</p>

<p>It needed no word of Unis to tell him what it
was. The light that glowed about its pure white
leather cover proved it the Book of Books.</p>

<p>The overjoyed Magician advanced toward the
young priest, but suddenly halted, as he caught
the horrible expression which distorted the latter’s
livid face. It was as if Unis was being
compelled against his will to hold the Book.</p>

<p>Unis’ eyes were open, but they did not seem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
to see. His feet carried him along, whither he
seemed not to care. Foam flecked his blackened
lips; beads of perspiration stood out upon
his forehead.</p>

<p>Gazing straight before him, slowly Unis advanced.
Hesitating for a bare second at the
threshold of the doorway—one might have supposed
that he was unfamiliar with it—he
slowly entered the chamber, set the Book carefully
down upon a cedar table near the upper
wall, turned and left as silently as he had entered.</p>

<p>The room, which had formerly been in total
darkness, was now illumined as though by a
temple lamp. For a moment Unis paused,
turned his unseeing eyes full upon his master,
the next he had vanished behind a great stone
stela which stood beside the ancient tomb which
had been his dwelling place.</p>

<p>Far better it had been for Unis had he continued
to fear the pursuing fury of the <i>ka</i>-statue
of the son of Hap!</p>

<p>Alas for Unis! Searching one day through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
the manuscripts of the library of Hotephra,
Great High Priest of Amen, he had stumbled
upon the son of Hap’s will. It lay folded in
the High Priest’s copy of the temple ritual. The
secret hiding-place of the Book was thus revealed
to him.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X<br />
<span class="smcap smaller">Pharaoh Seeks to Exalt a Foreign God</span></h2>

<p class="dropcap">Pharoah stirred.</p>

<p>At once two ebony black Nubians recommenced
to wave their ostrich-feather fans
above his restless head.</p>

<p>Again did Shamash, an Asiatic eunuch, hold
to his master’s nose a small glass phial of somnific
poppy-oil.</p>

<p>Once again did Bekit, his little daughter,
chafe with fragrant sandal oil his fleshless
ankles.</p>

<p>All in vain! Pharaoh’s frame failed to relax.</p>

<p>Suddenly, with an impatient gesture, Pharaoh
pushed aside the ivory head-rest and summoned
Dedu, Keeper of the Royal Linen.</p>

<p>The rebuffed, but smiling Bekit, held to her
father’s lips a blue glazed goblet filled to its
lotiform brim with sparkling Thinite wine. As
he drank, the swaying forms of Ata and Mai,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
youngest of the court dancers, rose from the
floor beyond him. Barely had they assumed a
single graceful posture before the gold seal-ring
upon Pharaoh’s hand flashed in the semi-gloom.
He waved them impatiently aside.</p>

<p>Entering softly, Dedu, Keeper of the Royal
Linen, carefully drew back the curtains from
the windows. These green byssus draperies
had served to keep out the brilliant rays of the
sun, as reflected from Queen Thi’s “pleasure
lake,” on the northern shore of which Perao, the
royal palace, stood.</p>

<p>Thus, one might admire the charming decoration
of the room, with its green tiled walls, its
cedar columns, its elaborately designed ceiling,
and its painted stucco floor covered with powdered
lazuli and gold dust.</p>

<p>In answer to a hasty motion on the part of
his silent master, Dedu commenced to bind him
in the long, flaring-skirted gala robes of the
day, things of wonder for the seemingly innumerable
ramifications of their softly rippling
white pleats. A gem-encrusted belt of ruddy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
Nubian gold was clasped about his slender
waist, a girdle broad in the back and tapering
towards the front, where a fiercely charging
oryx, carved from a solid block of Babylonian
lazuli, served to conceal the mechanism of the
clasp. The restless monarch’s feet were bound
in soft gazelle-hide sandals, sandals dyed a
rich rose-pink, gilded and turned up at the toe.
Over a padded linen skull-cap was set the royal
warbonnet, a magnificent dome-shaped headdress
of a brilliant sky blue. From the center
of this regal head-covering, and immediately
above the monarch’s low and unnaturally retreating
forehead, the red jasper eyes of two
golden asps glittered like spots of hidden fire,
as they quivered upon flexible wires with every
movement of the impatient monarch.</p>

<p>In public, the vain and indolent monarchs
who had followed Thothmes, Conqueror of Asia,
had ever affected the Warbonnet above all other
headdresses. At sight of its bright blue inlays
the discreet and sycophantic courtiers invariably
burst into vociferous applause; the soldiers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
with howls of delight, broke into stirring
war-dances. With the people at large it was
hailed with delight. To them it symbolized Imperial
Egypt, an Egypt to which tribute arrived
from Nubia to the “great bend” of the distant
Euphrates. Thus, policy had dictated the
Linen Keeper’s choice, for the fiction of Pharaoh
as world-conqueror <em>must</em> be maintained.</p>

<p>Deftly the fawning Dedu encircled Pharaoh’s
emaciated arms and wrists with jeweled bands,
his hollow chest with the <i>wesekh</i>, a broad, flat
band of jewels composed of alternate strands of
varicolored stones. The tender green of
Nubian emerald, the soft rose of native carnelian,
the violet or rich purple of Asiatic
amethyst and the several red tones of translucent
sard and banded agate, were intensified
as much by Pharaoh’s swarthy countenance as
by the pure white linen tunic over which they
were spread.</p>

<p>Finally, the scepter of gold, banded with deep
red sardonyx, was placed in Pharaoh’s nervously
twitching hand, and Akhten-aton, “Terror<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
of Asia,” shuffled to the door, where his
ivory carrying-chair, his sixteen priestly bearers,
his sun-shade and fan-bearers, and his pet
lion, awaited him.</p>

<p>With the inevitable prayer for “health and
long life” upon their lips, one and all saluted
the god-king by raising their right hands and
crooking their lean backs in the obsequious
Syrian mode, but recently introduced.</p>

<p>In the columned forecourt of the Great Hall,
the stentorian voice of the Court Herald
warned of Pharaoh’s approach and Akhten-aton,
Son of the Sun-god, Lord of the Two
Lands, Ruler of Rulers, Bull that Goreth Bulls,
gave the looked-for signal that should start the
forward movement of that great procession
which would usher him into the Double Audience
Hall with all the dignity of a ruler, whose
sway, nominally at least, extended from the
further confines of Nubia to the Great River of
Mitanni.</p>

<p>Soon, no one but Wozer, Keeper of the Gates,
his spearmen and the cooks and butlers, remained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
within the palace walls. It was with a
sigh of satisfaction that Wozer heard the ever-receding
tones of the chanting prophets and
priestesses of the temple who headed the procession.</p>

<p>As Ptah the Cellarer rolled heavily by, Wozer
made a gesture expressive at once of thirst and
a good game. Thereafter, Ptah and he forgot,
for a time, that there was a gate to watch or
fragrant jars of wine to seal. Skull-cap to
headcloth, both lost themselves in a high-staked
game of draughts!</p>

<p>The Great Double Hall to which Pharaoh had
been conducted consisted of a long, high nave.
On either side this gigantic lotus-columned nave
stood smaller aisles. Both nave and aisles were
bathed in the subdued light which filtered
through pierced alabaster gratings.</p>

<p>The dimly seen roof was composed of huge
flat slabs of sandstone painted blue, and dotted
with myriads of little gold stars. The bulging
shafts of the columns which supported it—gigantic
pillars covered from capital to base<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
with brilliantly colored representations of
Egypt’s host of deities—glowed in the shimmering
light with a thousand prismatic colors.
The floor was of beaten gold, its high walls a
glitter of yellow tiles inlaid with varicolored
paste hieroglyphs. These seemingly unending
lines of inscription extolled the late Pharaoh for
gifts which he had given, perforce, to the temples,
or lauded him for certain imaginary deeds
of prowess performed in unknown campaigns
in Nubia and Asia.</p>

<p>At the upper end of the hall, raised upon a
low dais, stood the throne of Egypt, the
“golden throne of Horus.” As was fitting, its
curved arms were supported by the bent backs
of pinioned Nubians and Asiatics.</p>

<p>To the right, and immediately overlooking the
royal dais, was a balcony reserved for Noferith,
the Queen; for Thi, the all-powerful Queen-Mother,
and for a few favored ladies of their
suites. This balcony, at the moment, was hung
with rich embroideries.</p>

<p>In front of Pharaoh’s throne stood painted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
cedar vase-stands, from whose blue-glazed jars
drooped sprays of feathery acacia, sweet-scented
mimosa and nodding papyrus. To the
left, high upon a lotus-festooned stand, stood a
huge oryx-handled bowl of solid gold, part of
the Asiatic spoil of Pharaoh’s warlike ancestor
Thothmes, the conqueror of Asia. From its
fitfully glowing interior rose a thin blue line of
aromatic incense, which broke and spread in
gray, semi-transparent rings as it touched the
gold stars which dimly flashed amidst the deep
blue of its lofty ceiling.</p>

<p>The herald’s announcement of the approach
of Pharaoh stopped for a moment the sibilant
whispers of the ladies, as the court nobles, a
line of white-robed figures, ranged themselves
about the dais in order of precedence. Soon
after, to the acclaiming shouts of the multitude,
Akhten-aton, himself, appeared. Assisted by
Shamash and the ever-attentive Dedu, Pharaoh
slowly seated himself upon the throne of his
ancestors.</p>

<p>Following a motion from his long thin hand,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
an usher threw wide the cedar doors at the end
of the hall and, standing upon its granite
threshold, cried to the vast concourse of restless
figures now visible in the court:</p>

<p>“Long live Pharaoh, our Lord!</p>

<p>“Millions of millions of years to him, even so
long as the sun endureth!”</p>

<p>With a roar the accustomed royal salutation
was taken up:</p>

<p>“Life, health, abundance and fullness of joy
be to Pharaoh, our Lord, forever and forever!”</p>

<p>The crowd of petty nobles, counts, monarchs
and captains now pressed forward. With heads
bent, spines arched, right hands raised, slowly
and reverently they ranged themselves about
the lower end of the hall. Were it possible, the
forms of these white-robed newcomers flashed
with the glitter of well-nigh as many jewels and
gold or silver orders as did those of the more
exalted nobles gathered about Pharaoh’s
throne.</p>

<p>Those who were unable, for lack of space, to
gain access to the hall, had perforce, to stand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
outside in the unprotected court and exposed to
the blinding shafts of the vaulting sun.
Yet, few complained, so momentous was the
step now contemplated by the fanatical young
Pharaoh.</p>

<p>Anticipation and, it may well have been fear
of the result, explained the unusual sternness
of expression visible upon the faces of all present,
a tension seldom seen upon the faces of this
pleasure-loving people.</p>

<p>For weeks past the Theban capital, nay,
Egypt itself, had been a seething maelstrom of
riotous priests, mutinous soldiery, and piteously
clamorous slaves and petty farmers.</p>

<p>With the speed of a hungry jackal the news
had spread that Pharaoh had at last determined
upon the final break with the priests of Amen in
Karnak.</p>

<p>Pharaoh’s keen interest in the Syrian cult of
Thi, his mother, was well known. The new Sun
cult already had a certain following, at least
among the nobles of the court. At this very
moment many members of the nobility had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
recently bound themselves to support their
royal master in the revolutionary step he now
contemplated.</p>

<p>It is true that the more exalted members of
Pharaoh’s court still continued their visits to
the great temple of Amen in Karnak. But the
nasal intonation of Ameni, the ibis-nosed lector,
had of late merely served to amuse them. As to
Pharaoh, himself, the over-powering reek of
incense, flowers, fresh-baked bread, and blood,
did but sicken him. The glitter in the silver eyes
of a host of granite statues, ancestors of his,
<i>ka</i>-figures of a long line of loyal and devout followers
of Amen, both unnerved and repelled him.</p>

<p>From his golden throne Pharaoh’s prominent
eyes swept the oil-coned heads of his subjects.
One and all were dressed, be-jeweled and
anointed as for a gala day. Their loyal shouts
of welcome had warmed his heart. At the same
time, their enthusiasm seemed to give him the
necessary strength for his momentous task.</p>

<p>No sooner was he seated, and the jeweled
scepter placed upon a stand at his side, than the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
nobles on his right, ever the most exalted,
pressed about him. Some prostrated themselves
before him; some kissed the pointed tip of his
gilded sandal, while others, in this case the aged
members of his court or blood relations, embraced
the pleated skirt that tightly bound his
knees.</p>

<p>Suddenly Pharaoh signaled that he would
hear no more, and immediately, with a wave of
his scepter, rose to his feet.</p>

<p>At once, as if by magic, whisperings ceased.
No one so much as breathed. Such a hush fell
upon that crowded hall that one could hear
without the shrill cries of the quarrelsome
hawks, that flew in circles back and forth from
the eaves of the roof.</p>

<p>As one, that vast audience sank to its knees.
As one, it broke into the stirring shout of welcome:</p>

<p>“Hail, Life-giver! Hail, Electrum of Kings!
Hail, Thou who art the very breath of our nostrils!
Life, health and peace be thine, so long as
Ra endures!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>Then again the same expectant hush fell upon
that shimmering hall. Pharaoh raised his hand.
His soft, but resonant voice filled the long hall:</p>

<p>“My children! We have summoned you before
us that you may hear the words of Pharaoh,
which change not! For centuries past
hath Egypt been a jest in the mouths of
strangers who cried:</p>

<p>“These be the sons of the Egyptians that
have raised to themselves more gods than they
have days in which to worship them.’ Had we
not been hindered by the priests of Amen yonder,
long ago, yea, even in our fathers’ time, this
reproach had been removed from amongst us!
Henceforth, my children, cease to cry upon the
Triads; upon Amen, Mut, and Khonsu; upon
Horus, Set and Ausar!</p>

<p>“As you all know, the gods of Thebes, of On,
of white-walled Memphis, are but attributes of
the one beneficent sun-god, of Aton the Glorious,
the Life-giver, who dwelleth within the
Sun!</p>

<p>“Henceforth, let Aton, not Amen, be upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
your lips! Let Aton, not Amen, be upon the lips
of your children! Thus, as in times past, Egypt
shall worship one god from Nubia to Suan of
the North. May Aton’s bright beams embrace
you! May Aton’s rays forever enfold you!”</p>

<p>Across the flashing waters of the Nile, where
the great temple of Karnak raised its giant
pylons high above the palm groves which
fronted it, Huy, Great High Priest of Amen,
frowned darkly as the sound of the loud applause
which followed Pharaoh’s speech,
reached his ears.</p>

<p>To Huy and the prophets of Amen that sound
heralded the beginning of a war to the death.</p>

<p>But Enana, the Magician, did but smile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI<br />
<span class="smcap smaller">The Statue of Amen Disappears</span></h2>

<p class="dropcap">In Thebes a religious drama was enacted
annually, a drama in which was portrayed
the eternal conflict waged between Amen,
the sun-god, and Apep, Prince of Darkness.</p>

<p>Unknown to the peasant, as indeed to many
a priestly participant, the story of the drama, in
truth, perpetuated the prehistoric invasion of
Egypt by those “Followers of Horus” who had
subdued, and, eventually, become absorbed by
the original inhabitants of the Nile Valley.</p>

<p>At that early date, Thebes had been but a
small village, a cluster of mud huts and a small
shrine, over whose walls rose the emblem of the
primitive cult.</p>

<p>Since that time, three thousand years had
come and gone, and Thebes had become the
richest and most powerful city of the ancient
world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>Now, since Horus, son of Hathor, was the
leader of the victorious invaders, and the two
great battles had taken place at Nekhen and
Abdu—Thebes being entirely outside the field
of operations—the various incidents enacted in
this great religious spectacle had nothing whatever
to do with Thebes nor, indeed, with its
famed local deity, the sun-god Amen.</p>

<p>But the priests of Amen’s great temple at
Thebes had always looked with envy at the
popularity of the yearly spectacle as enacted in
the two rival cities. Thus, when finally a Theban
prince became Pharaoh, the first care of the
Chief Prophet of Amen had been to get the
royal seal affixed to a permit looking toward the
perpetual endowment of a similar festival in his
own city of Thebes, a six days’ wonder that
should utterly eclipse anything of which
Nekhen, Abdu or any other rival god or city
could boast.</p>

<p>In the drama as presented at Thebes, the son
of Hathor became the sun-god Amen of Thebes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
The “Followers of Horus” were personified by
Theban priests, local notables and others.</p>

<p>As to the “Followers of Set,” the enemies in
the drama, such miscreants were portrayed by
unhappy foreign slaves, criminals and the like,
many of whom were sacrificed before the altar
of the sun-god, following the conclusion of the
customary mimic battle and mock attempt to
carry off the holy statue of Amen.</p>

<p>The great Theban festival called for a full
week of continued merrymaking. Military
tournaments were instituted, athletic contests
took place; boat races were a daily occurrence
along the river front. In the palace magical
contests were held, the wisdom of ancient sages
was discussed, or great prophets of the day
were brought before Pharaoh’s throne.</p>

<p>In the latter case Pharaoh heard, at first hand,
of the marvelous deeds of magic under the ancestors
of the Pyramid Age, or was admonished
to give more thought to his oppressed and hungry
people.</p>

<p>One stalwart hermit had had the temerity to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
prophesy the overthrow of Pharaoh and the
coming of “a righteous king,” under whom
Egypt would return to the blissful state of long
ago, “before death was,” and mankind, both
native and foreign, would become united in an
international brotherhood which would make
one the lands of men and the Blessed fields of
Aaru, the abode of the gods!</p>

<p>The rash prophet was not handed to the
strangler, but led courteously from the Presence.
An order for a tomb, a fine limestone
coffin, and a tomb-statue, followed him to his
distant home. During the Feast of the Apts,
one might speak one’s true mind, even before
Majesty.</p>

<p>To-day, the day of “bringing in the god,”
crowds jostled and pushed along every Theban
lane and alley. Everyone sought the Avenue of
Sphinxes, or the River Road. The latter route,
which extended from the main pylon of the
Temple to the Sacred Quay, was policed along
its short extent by a double line of foreign
spearmen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>The two-horse chariot of the chief of these
mercenaries dashed madly up the well guarded
course, turned and disappeared down the long
Avenue of Sphinxes which led to the Southern
Temple. The Chief would take one last survey
of the flower-strewn route before the “Appearance
of the sun-god” should commence.</p>

<p>The gold statue of Amen the Hidden One,
would presently be taken from the Holy of
Holies in the dim shrine of the Northern Apt,
and escorted upstream on the Sacred Barge to
the jeweled sanctuary of the Temple of the
Southern Apt.</p>

<p>Before the open cedar doors of the temple
Pharaoh himself might be seen upon his portable
throne of gold and ivory, high above the
shoulders of twenty-four priestly bearers. As
usual, his tame lion stood upon the dais at its
royal master’s side.</p>

<p>The grand procession now moved forward.
It was headed by a priest, who solemnly burned
incense in a long hawk-headed bronze censer.
All about him musicians played and women-of-the-temple,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
women playing to the mystical
harem of the god, sang the adorations to the
sun-god. Two other groups marked time by
clapping of hands and playing of ivory castanets.</p>

<p>Immediately in front of the king’s throne
marched serried ranks of kilted Egyptian soldiers,
singing as they went. Their raw-hide
shields moved across their naked breasts in time
with the music. At the close of each verse they
lifted their short spears or axes above their
heads and shouted a short but resounding:
“Hai! Amen! Ya—hai! Amen!”</p>

<p>Soon the long lines of onlookers had taken up
the refrain, and the limpid air of the Capital
thrilled to the wild cries of “Hai! Amen! Ya—hai!
Amen!” As the gold throne of the
Monarch advanced, groups of White-robed
nobles fell into line behind it.</p>

<p>Then followed a long line of women from the
Temples of Amen, Mut and Khonsu, who
marked the time of the hymn of praise by shaking
golden sistra and rattling <i>menats</i>, short<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
but thick necklaces of beryl, amethyst and carnelian
beads. With much beating of drums and
clicking of castanets a group of feathered
negroes pressed close after the singers.</p>

<p>There followed another long line of soldiers,
Egyptian, Asiatic, Nubian, Libyan, and, finally,
a little group of Cretans, remarkable not so
much for the breadth of their shoulders as for
the slimness of their waists, “hornet waisted”
they had been nicknamed by the Thebans. These
latter were almost lost behind their enormous
ox-hide shields.</p>

<p>Each group carried its own special type of
weapon, since there were definite regiments of
archers, axemen, spearmen and slingers, and
each company was headed by its own device or
standard bearer.</p>

<p>At last the heavy bronze doors of the Temple
of Amen slowly opened and a seemingly unending
line of white-robed priests issued from the
deep shadows of the stupendous pylons.</p>

<p>High upon their gleaming shoulders rested
portable barques containing the various sacred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
deities belonging to the various temples which
were well-nigh hidden by the lofty enclosure
walls. Certain priests offered incense to these
gods, at intervals, along the whole extent of the
route.</p>

<p>In the midst of one group might be seen a
number of spirited bulls, with horns decorated
in gold. Great yokes of flowers and sweet-smelling
leaves were hung about their throats.</p>

<p>Trailing out behind these last followed a long
line of priests carrying the standards of the
gods, since the whole company of the Blessed
Gods marched, unseen, in this great procession.</p>

<p>A renewed wave of cheering went up as the
linen-draped shrine of Amen appeared. A
vacant place was kept clear behind it, in which
marched the “souls” of dead kings! Thirty-six
tall priests carried this Holy of Holies towards
a gleaming barge, moored to the water’s edge
at the Sacred Quay. Over two hundred feet
long, this barge was built throughout its entire
extent of cedar from the Lebanus Terraces. Its
sides were covered to the water’s edge with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
pure Nubian gold. Enormous necklaces of gold
were hung at prow and stern. The “Two eyes
of Horus,” at the prow, were inlaid in brilliant
blue lazuli from Babylon. The great checkered
linen sail, which lay furled upon the silver deck,
was of the square Egyptian type. It was decorated
with squares of red and blue embroidery.</p>

<p>There was now as much noise and excitement
on the river as on shore. The captains of fifty
great painted barges awaited the signal to pull
up their mooring-stakes as soon as the Sacred
Barge should be well under way. Were it possible,
the startled air trembled to still louder
shouts as excited overseers, taskmasters and
men commenced to pull at the great towing
ropes. The swift Nile current made it necessary
that the barge be dragged upstream by a
whole army of young and lusty Egyptians.</p>

<p>Along the line of route people began to disappear
from the gayly decorated windows. The
last scene of the day’s ceremony was about to
take place within the still unfinished forecourt
of the Southern Temple of Amen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>Carrying-chairs were frantically demanded,
but soon abandoned, as who could make headway
in that fashion in the midst of such a
crowd? A few fortunate people managed to
squeeze through the broad square lined with its
rows of booths, where slaves were hastily preparing
wine, fruit, flowers and incense or cutting
up the unfortunate bulls as part of the
“beautiful festival of the Apt.”</p>

<p>Pharaoh offered incense to his father Amen
as four exalted members of the priesthood
poured out wine from festooned jars of painted
pottery. With the exception of these four
noblemen, high initiates of the Sorcerers of
Amen and Huy, the Great High Priest, no one
could witness the taking of the image of Amen
from its jeweled shrine and its transference to
the silver tabernacle within the granite naos
which stood, beside “the position which the
king takes,” deep within the gloom of the upper
temple.</p>

<p>Pharaoh himself, though the personification
of Amen, dare not venture beyond that fixed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
“position,” a spot marked by a huge block of
turquoise from the Sinaitic mines, set in the
richly painted wall of the upper temple.</p>

<p>Around the great forecourt, the nobles knelt
or stood, according as they belonged to the two
rival factions of Amen or Aton.</p>

<p>To the latter group, this marked what was no
doubt the very last procession of its kind. Hence
these adherents of Aton, the Syrian God, stood
stiffly in the background. A covert smile might
have been noted on many a swarthy face among
them.</p>

<p>Pharaoh’s expression was one of cold indifference.</p>

<p>Throughout the whole scene the apathetic
monarch seemed not to be conscious of where
he was or of what he was doing. It is true, he
successfully finished each and every detail of
the exacting ritual of Amen. But, what he did,
he did mechanically.</p>

<p>The last mock-reverence finished, Pharaoh
retired.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>As his throne was borne swiftly toward the
royal barge, his mask of impassibility vanished.
He sank back and allowed his gaze to travel
from one side to the other. There was an air
of expectancy in each turn of his head. He even
went so far as to bow to the acclamations of
his people, and this not a little to their bewilderment,
since Pharaohs, in public, were customarily,
at best, but breathing statues.</p>

<p>Scarcely had the king set foot upon the deck
of his beautiful barge, “Star of the Gods,”
when a frightful tumult broke out along the
bank, immediately fronting the great barge of
Amen. Wild shrieks from the women-of-the-temple,
hoarse and angry cries from the men,
intermingled with mocking laughter and shouts
of derision.</p>

<p>A great crowd of angry priests of Amen
might be seen pushing their way through the
dense crowd which was massed in front of the
giant statues of Thothmes, whose temple stood
near by. Frantic attempts were being made by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
the priests of Amen to burst through this crowd.
Yet each insistent attempt ended in failure, as
did a last charge in one serried block.</p>

<p>The crowd itself was by now so divided into
factions that blows were falling right and left,
and hapless people were constantly being
trampled under foot.</p>

<p>Shrieking: “Sacrilege! Sacrilege!” the
priests turned and rushed headlong to their
boats.</p>

<p>The Holy figure of the Hidden One, the
sacred Statue of Amen, the sun-god, had disappeared.</p>

<p>The followers of Aton had scored their first
success, and that success one of tremendous import!</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII<br />
<span class="smcap smaller">Enana Calls to His Aid the Gods Justice and Vengeance</span></h2>

<p class="dropcap">The nameless horror that had driven the
youthful Unis from his side had no terrors
for Enana the Magician.</p>

<p>Enana stood bathed in the palpitating glow
of the self-illuminated Book. Slowly he approached
his hands to its cover, a cover as white
as the sandals of the gods themselves.</p>

<p>The instant Enana’s shriveled fingers came in
contact with its radiance, a sudden change came
over him. Enana’s face glowed; a circle of
light played about his head. His eyes blazed
with a light of triumph.</p>

<p>Holding the Magic Book before him, he commenced
to sway back and forth, back and forth,
like some mystic of the temple about to
prophesy.</p>

<p>The aged Magician began to speak, softly at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
first, but with a flow of words that scarcely
waited for breath.</p>

<p>“What saith the son of Hap? Seek the Book
of Thoth. Eat not, drink not, sleep not, until
the Book is found! Two magic formulæ hath
the Book! Recite the first and thou shalt charm
the sky, the earth, the moon, the heights, the
depths! Thou shalt converse with the birds.
Thou shalt understand the sayings of the fish
and reptiles!</p>

<p>“Recite the second and, even though thy
desire be among the Silent Ones, the Dead,
yet shall thou have power to raise them upon
their feet in the forms and with the hearts their
mothers gave them.</p>

<p>“By the Double Spell thou shalt produce a
Rising of the Moon at will. Thou shalt be enabled
to stop the Sun’s Ascension. Yea, thou
shalt darken the faces of both Sun and Moon.
By the Double Spell thou shalt see the Ascension
of Ra and the Cycle of the Gods.</p>

<p>“Recited at the full of the Moon, thou shalt
master the Hidden Names of the Gods, whereby<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
thou shalt become possessed of their amulets
and talismans. Yea, thou shalt become greater
than Ra himself!”</p>

<p>Slowly Enana the Magician opened the Book.
In characters of gold the secret incantations
of the gods were spread before him. Here appeared
the Secret Names of the Six White Gods
of Day and the Six Black Gods of Night. Here
were the irresistible words of power that could
stop the planets in their courses and Ra in his
passage of the sky. Here again were the Mystic
Names of Thoth and Set. Here were the
dread <i>hekau</i>-spells that could revivify the dead
or consign the living to annihilation and their
“doubles” to extinction.</p>

<p>Enana closed the magic book. Carefully he
placed it in his bosom. The soft effulgence at
once disappeared.</p>

<p>Leaving the little chamber, Enana stood upon
the terrace. Below and about him stretched the
city, the city of the dead. A rift of dully gleaming
waters and, beyond it, lay another city,
the city of the living.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>A dull roar, a deep murmur, as of many
voices, came up to him where he stood. In
honor of the annual Feast of the Apts, lights
were breaking out alike in temple, palace and
peasant hut.</p>

<p>To-night the doors would be left open. Thus
would the living welcome the “souls” of their
dead.</p>

<p>Already lines of flickering torches showed
where many a devout <i>ka</i>-servant, together with
priests to assist him, could be seen winding
along the well-beaten paths or marching up the
inclined planes of the sphinx or tree-bordered
avenues by which the royal mortuary-temples
were approached.</p>

<p>The Feast of the Apts was indeed, as it was
often styled, a veritable “Feast of Lights.”</p>

<p>Enana gazed northward. Across the river, a
bright circle of lights showed where his brother-priests
of Amen had commenced the encircling
of the walls of Amen’s temple. Huy and his
brother-priests still put on a bold front.</p>

<p>Fires were lit at intervals along the Nile embankments.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
The river itself now reflected many
a fire that leaped, died, and leaped into life
again, along the great quay fronting the temple
of the Southern Apt.</p>

<p>Nearer, scarcely a stone’s throw away, it
seemed, appeared the lights of the innumerable
lamps which served to illuminate the pleasure-barge
of Thi, the Queen-Mother. As Enana well
knew, Pharaoh and his immediate family were
accustomed to join the nightly fête from this
point of vantage.</p>

<p>Enana raised his hands in the direction of the
broad patch of buildings and trees which
marked at once the royal palace and the nearby
villa of Menna, the Overseer.</p>

<p>Suddenly a brilliant meteor shot from the
highest zenith and seemed to bury itself in the
waters of the palace lake. Enana’s voice rose
upon the night air:</p>

<div class="verse">Annihilation is your portion; obliteration</div>

</div>
</div>

<p>Enana’s voice rose to a shrill falsetto; his
whole form seemed to tremble as he cried aloud
the first dread incantation:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p>As the aged Magician’s voice shrilled out
upon the night air Bata, the unhappy Unis’
aged nurse, suddenly awoke.</p>

<p>Softly she stole down the corridor from a
chamber at the rear of the tomb, where she
usually slept. Bata reached the open door just
in time to hear Enana command the very gods
to descend to earth. The horrified Bata fell
in a faint across the threshold.</p>

<p>When at length Bata returned to consciousness,
she somehow managed to crawl back to her
room, dumb with terror. Bata had seen the old
Magician’s trembling form aglow with a mystic
light, his upturned face shining with some
inward flame. Before him, out of the gloom
there had suddenly appeared two heavily
cloaked figures. Bata never doubted but that
the tall forms were those of the great gods
Thoth and Set.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII<br />
<span class="smcap smaller">Ramses and Sesen</span></h2>

<p class="dropcap">The youthful Ramses, leader of the recent
successful expedition against the Nubians,
had won for himself many titles of distinction.
Yet, chief among these undoubtedly,
was his new appointment to the rank of Fan-Bearer-on-the-Right-of-Pharaoh.</p>

<p>The post of Fan-Bearer was an office eagerly
sought by the more exalted nobles, since it gave
one the ear of Pharaoh, as did perhaps no other
position at Court. The one possible exception
was the post held by Dedu, son of Den, through
four generations at least, the coveted post of
Keeper-of-the-King’s-Robes.</p>

<p>The title of Fan-Bearer had been given
Ramses by Pharaoh at Thi’s earnest solicitation.
The Queen-Mother had been prompted to this
step through no love she bore the youthful soldier,
but as part of a plan which was intended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
to lull the stubborn adherents of Amen into a
sense of false security.</p>

<p>The aged Enana, grandfather to Ramses,
was the subject of the Queen-Mother’s especial
detestation. Indeed, detestation was by far too
mild a word to express her feelings in respect to
the old magician.</p>

<p>By conferring the title of Fan-Bearer upon
Enana’s grandson, Thi hoped to put Enana and
the other followers of Amen off their guard.
For, would not the very title imply a definite
and continuous sojourn in the capital?</p>

<p>Yet, of late, Thi felt that the attempt to keep
the young soldier near the Court had been ill-advised.
For various rumors, vague hints of an
alarming nature, had reached the ears of Menna
the Overseer.</p>

<p>These ill-defined rumors had been promptly
reported to Thi, with various embellishments, of
course, on the part of Menna, son of Menna.</p>

<p>Without a doubt, someone who knew the
Court, someone who was familiar with the
secret intrigues of harem life in the palace, had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
been quietly spreading broadcast palace secrets
of a most terrifying nature.</p>

<p>One report had it that the present Pharaoh
was a Syrian, born before Thi’s parents came
down into Egypt.</p>

<p>It was hinted that Yakab the Chancellor was
his true father. Had they not both the same
extraordinarily attenuated figure? Did not
both suffer from the same racking cough? Did
not both speak with a marked lisp? Thi, the
Queen-Mother, was almost stout; the late Pharaoh
had been a corpulent man, in his youth
possessed of unusual strength. The face was
that of Thi, perhaps, but the body that of Yakab
the Chancellor!</p>

<p>Yes, it was plain that Thi had done away with
Pharaoh’s former wife, the Lady Hanit; that
Menna and Thi had planned the murder of the
true heir to the throne, the Lady Hanit’s son,
in order that Yakab’s son, by Thi, might ascend
the Egyptian throne.</p>

<p>Finally it was whispered that the murdered
Prince still lived; that he had escaped from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
Menna, son of Menna, into whose baleful charge
he had been placed.</p>

<p>All unwittingly, Ramses had been drawn into
this maelstrom of palace intrigue. His name
was frequently mentioned in connection with
the probable succession to the throne.</p>

<p>The subject of a successor to the Horus
Throne was one of great importance at this
moment. Queen Noferith had borne the king
but girls—“five little beams of Shu the sun-god”
their royal father had playfully called
them. And of these one had recently become
the perfume of the heavenly lotus which the
sun-god holds to his august face!</p>

<p>Pharaoh felt sure that Ramses himself knew
nothing of these rumors. In many a bitter discussion
with his mother and Menna the Overseer
Pharaoh had frequently stated his conviction
that Ramses would utterly condemn such
traitorous thoughts should they ever come to his
ears.</p>

<p>Pharaoh had loved Ramses like a brother.
He had admired him as some superior being.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
For a time neither Menna’s craftily embellished
reports nor Thi’s openly avowed hatred of
Enana’s grandson could turn Pharaoh from his
blind trust in the good faith of his boyhood’s
hero.</p>

<p>Himself ever a sickly child, Pharaoh had
sighed for his coming of age, that he might take
the field with Ramses, and be himself a witness
of the latter’s many deeds of valor.</p>

<p>For years had Pharaoh pictured himself in
the famous Warbonnet of the Pharaohs, that
bright blue headdress which Thothmes and a
long line of heroic forebears had carried far
into the ranks of their stricken foes and, with
one exception, returned in safety to their acclaiming
people. Yes, even King Sequenen’s
horrible death, at the hands of the Hyksos invaders,
was better far than his present life of
inaction, a life varied only by tiresome harem
plots, counterplots and the probabilities of a
general religious or civil upheaval.</p>

<p>But Pharaoh, under Thi’s baleful influence,
was as pliable as the clay in the deft fingers of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
the potter. The Queen-Mother presently took
fright at these oft-repeated and ever highly-colored
rumors, and it was not long before she
and Menna had convinced Pharaoh that the
grandson of Enana, at Thebes, was a constant
menace.</p>

<p>Thus, when “the rewards of the King” were
yet warm in Ramses’ hands, that happy young
warrior was dismayed to receive a roll of
papyrus, straight from the hands of Majesty, a
brief note whose finely written contents necessitated
another exile from Sesen, from Thebes
and the home he so dearly loved, the villa of
Enana the Magician, his grandsire. Ramses
was commanded to depart for the north with
the setting of the morrow’s sun, there to take
over the Egyptian army guarding the hostile
frontier in Asia. Bitter disappointment, and
somewhat of anger, caused the voice of Ramses
to tremble as he directed his chairmen to set
him down at Enana’s villa.</p>

<p>The home of Ramses’ grandsire was built
upon a circular island on the western side of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
the Nile. Seen from a distance, this island appeared
to float upon the quiet waters. The
low white walls which surrounded its garden, its
branching cedars, full crested palms and
feathery mimosa trees, were mirrored in the
waters of the inundation.</p>

<p>Enana the Magician had felt called upon to
live comparatively near to Semet, Thebes’ unending
burial ground, since, during the former
monarch’s lifetime he had been appointed
“Guardian of the Royal Tombs.”</p>

<p>Enana was proud of his skill in necromancy;
Enana was even more proud of his knowledge of
astrology, botany, medicine and of his intimate
acquaintance with the Magic Scrolls of the Conjurers
and Sorcerers of Amen. But, above all
else, Enana enjoyed hearing himself addressed
as Guardian of the Ancestors, whenever a summons
from Majesty or a Court Function had
necessitated his presence at the Palace. Alas,
as far as Enana and Renet, his wife, were concerned,
such functions had long since ceased!</p>

<p>Nevertheless, to-day was a gala day with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
Enana, a day of rejoicing to his entire household.
For to-day Enana, son of Enana, had
arrived at the ever-prayed for one hundred and
ten years!</p>

<p>One other living person alone could boast of
such a record and that was the father of Thi, the
Queen-Mother. But Iuya was only a nobleman
by courtesy, an Asiatic, an heretical believer in
Aton. Enana scorned Iuya as a pretentious old
scoundrel, who spent the major part of his time
decrying everything Egyptian and lauding
Syria, and all things Syrian.</p>

<p>All morning had the aged Magician, and the
Lady Renet, his wife, sat beside the garden pool
listening to the effusive congratulations of his
friends, his neighbors, and the many members
of his house and wide domain.</p>

<p>All that morning his bustling servants had
been busy arranging the various presents along
the awning-shaded corridor which faced the
tree-set garden.</p>

<p>Bars and collarettes of gold, electrum and
silver; bead stands of lazuli, malachite, crystal,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
carnelian, amethyst, beryl, jasper; great pendants
in gold, silver or bright blue fayence;
finger-rings of gold encrusted with colored
pastes or set with little green glazed beetles,
carved in stone and engraved below with felicitous
expressions; treasures big and little were
piled high in seemingly innumerable vessels and
exposed on brightly painted wooden tables or
stands along the halls and corridors.</p>

<p>Clusters of white, soft pink or pale blue lotus
flowers were bound about frames bent to represent
the <i>anekh</i> or sign of “longevity.” The
<i>nofer</i> or sign of “happiness,” in the shape of
little lutes, hung from every branch in the garden.</p>

<p>There had been but one thing lacking in a
morning of never-to-be-forgotten successes. As
Khufu the Butler had remarked, not a single
member of the Royal House had visited their
honored master; not even a Royal Usher had
come with the customary messages of felicitation
or with the usual “gold of honor.” To
Khufu, as to the other devoted servants of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
aged Magician, this neglect was the occasion of
grave concern.</p>

<p>Not so to Enana! Well he knew the reason
of this breach of courtesy, this public affront.</p>

<p>Enana’s early training had been behind the
walls of Amen’s great temple in the Apt. There
for years had he served Amen, God of Thebes,
as chorister, incense-bearer, lector, <i>keri heb</i>
and, lastly, as Chief Magician.</p>

<p>Enana was known as a devoted follower of
Amen, as an ardent and incorruptible believer
in the power of the greatest of all gods, Amen
of Thebes. As such he knew well that he had
incurred the undying hatred of Thi the Syrian,
whose one ambition in life, now that her son
was established on the throne, was the overthrow
of Amen and the destruction of all the
other local gods of Egypt. If Thi could compass
it, Aton, the Syrian sun-god, should be the
sole object of worship from Suan of the north to
Suan of the south.</p>

<p>At the present moment, however, Enana had
pushed from his mind all thoughts of Thi. All<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
his present enjoyment was centered in the
scheme next his heart and in his anticipation of
seeing Ramses, his grandson, whom it mostly
concerned.</p>

<p>At any moment the young soldier might dash
through the gate in that impetuous way so dear
to the frail old man.</p>

<p>Enana sat with his wrinkled hands resting
upon the squares of gold leaf with which his
tunic was faced. His beady black eyes were
fixed upon the open door, his ears alert to catch
the first shout of Ramses’ bearers, as they
rounded the great Mortuary Temple near by.
From time to time his hand went to his bosom
where rested the magic book.</p>

<p>But the sun-god began his descent into the
realms of darkness, lights broke out in the distant
city, a line of chanting priests bearing
torches appeared upon the walls of Amenhotep’s
temple, the light upon the high stand at
Enana’s elbow was lit. Yet Ramses did not
come.</p>

<p>Ah, Enana, but a little patience! Magician<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
though thou art, the Goddess Hathor is more
powerful than thou!</p>

<p>Even as Ramses had finished reading the
royal command and set his hand to the arm of
his carrying-chair, Seneb the Usher advanced
bowing and handed him a second note.</p>

<p>Joy lit up the stern face of the young soldier
as he read; a sudden animation seemed to fill
his whole being. Bidding his chairmen await
him in the outer court, he turned and followed
Seneb, the Usher, through the columned aisles
of the Audience Hall.</p>

<p>Arrived before the line of granite sphinxes
which fronted the Treasury of Silver, Seneb
bowed again, turned on his heel and left him.</p>

<p>Three women stood beneath a doorway which
fronted the innermost court. Eagerly Ramses
advanced as the form of the Princess Sesen
stepped out from its shadows:</p>

<p>“Sesen, they told me thou wert with thy
Father in Thinis! Had I known, in truth, that
the Palace held thee, I would have come to
claim thy promised reward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>“By Hathor! Thou are more radiantly beautiful
than when I left thee last! How often have
I lain awake at night thinking of thee. The hot
nights upon the desert sand passed quickly,
restfully, for dreams of thee!</p>

<p>“Sesen, thou knowest all my love; all my
hopes are centered in thee. What are the
rewards of Majesty to the reward that thou hast
promised me—thyself. Look! I have kept my
word. I found the famous jewel which Enana
told thee of and—it is thine!”</p>

<p>Slowly Ramses drew from his girdle a great
emerald set in gold. A rose-colored band of
fine gazelle hide showed it to have been worn
about the forehead of its former owner, the
Nubian King.</p>

<p>King Shaba will need “the panther’s eye”
no more. His ashes lie beneath the smouldering
ruins of his palace. Vultures hover above the
demolished houses of Napata, his Capital.</p>

<p>Sesen clasped her hands upon her bosom with
delight. Without replying she took the jewel
from Ramses’ hand and bound it about her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
gold-filleted wig. Ramses smiled down upon the
happy little maid, as she sank into his arms.
The great jewel seemed to glow upon her forehead,
as if it pulsed to the rapid beating of her
heart:</p>

<p>“Sesen, my Lotus! I love thee, I love thee!”</p>

<p>“And I, Ramses, my hero, feared for thee.
Hathor’s altar has groaned beneath the burden
of my offerings for thy safe return.”</p>

<p>Her words brought to Ramses’ mind the command
of Pharaoh. He had found her but to lose
her.</p>

<p>“Dove of Hathor, but a few short weeks and
I return to claim thee for the Lady of my
House.”</p>

<p>“Thou returnest? Whither goest thou?”</p>

<p>“Alas, my Dove! The King commands
that I head the Egyptian host which now
stands facing Kheta and her allies in Syria.
By to-morrow’s sunset I must leave to help
old Noferhotep with his task. Yet, have no
fear for me. The Little People, I think,
do but try out Noferhotep. He, poor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
man, grows weary of the task of waiting,
with nothing but patrol work at best to break
the monotony of his years of frontier life. Fear
not for me. I have thy love, my Sesen! If
need be, I could cut my way through Asia, with
thy name my battle-cry. To-morrow I will see
thee after the morning service. The Lady
Renet and her maids will come to escort thee
to our house for the betrothal. Breath
of Ra, how happy will she be, she and
Enana, my grandsire. Now must I hurry to
them. As thou knowest, ’tis a gala day with my
grandsire. May Hathor bless thee, my Sesen;
may Aah cast her protecting beams about thee.”</p>

<p>For an instant the lovers held one another in
a close embrace. The next, Ramses had mounted
his chair. As he did so, twinkling lights broke
out among the dark patch of trees in which
stood Enana’s distant villa.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV<br />
<span class="smcap smaller">A Rash Promise</span></h2>

<p class="dropcap">In his wooing of the Lady Sesen, Menna, son
of Menna, worked tirelessly. Menna had
been born upon the fifth of Paophi, and who
does not know that a child born upon that
auspicious day is ever successful in affairs of
the heart!</p>

<p>Following his gift to her of Bhanar, the
beautiful Syrian, each day brought to Sesen
bunches of grapes, bursting pomegranates or
succulent dates from Menna’s famous gardens.
Frequently there were left at her door bags of
powdered gold or lazuli for the floor of her
rooms, or the choicest of fragrant oils and perfumes
for her toilet. These last were sealed in
little jars of rich blue glass or in black obsidian
vases capped with gold.</p>

<p>To-day Sesen opened an ebony coffer richly
inlaid with ivory and gold. Enclosed within she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
found a frail wooden spoon, an incense spoon,
carved to represent a little maiden stretched at
full length in the attitude of a swimmer. The
names and titles of Menna, the Overseer, appeared
upon this exquisite work of art, yet, if
truth be told, Renny the Syrian had fashioned
it.</p>

<p>As with Menna’s other gifts, a closely written
sheet of fine papyrus accompanied the gift,
whereon Sesen read of Menna’s passionate
desire for a meeting. Enana had advised her to
fan the flame of Menna’s passion for reasons he
kept to himself. What would he say to this
effusion!</p>

<p>The lines were written alternately in letters
of red and black:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">The cool zephyrs of the Northland can alone extinguish the flame of my love!</div>
<div class="verse">I am become like the dried mimosa, ripe for the baker’s oven,</div>
<div class="verse">The fire of her eyes hath withered it.</div>
<div class="verse">When the dove pours forth its plaintive song, Sesen appears beneath the sycamore.</div>
<div class="verse">Her slender form is mirrored in the garden pool.</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Seeing her, the Moon-goddess pines away with jealousy; the Sun-god bids her shine in his stead.</div>
<div class="verse">A full moon is her gleaming face;</div>
<div class="verse">The brightness of day glows upon her forehead;</div>
<div class="verse">Her full throat gleams like the crystals which encircle it;</div>
<div class="verse">The rose of the flamingo’s wing is upon her cheek;</div>
<div class="verse">Her eyes, painted with black Thinite kohl, were the gift of Hathor at her birth,</div>
<div class="verse">The fires that burn within them scatter flaming darts;</div>
<div class="verse">Countless as the desert sands are the victims of those eyes!</div>

<div class="verse">Her luster illuminates the darkest night!</div>

<div class="verse">She will tell thee that I am indeed the ally of sorrow and anguish.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>With a frown Sesen tore the note into little
pieces and went on with her interrupted game
of draughts with Merit-aton, Pharaoh’s eldest
daughter.</p>

<p>Until Menna had stumbled upon Renny, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
Syrian, hawking his despised figurines in the
inhospitable streets of Thinis, Beq, an Egyptian
sculptor attached to his house, had served
Menna the Overseer as messenger.</p>

<p>For Menna, when not on duty at the Palace,
was accustomed to rise late. Menna’s mornings
were spent at the bath. Indeed, it not infrequently
happened that the sun had begun
his downward flight across the heavens before
the lordly Overseer had succeeded in escaping
from the ministrations of his slaves.</p>

<p>For several hours he must perforce suffer
the attentions of his body-servants, his wig-keeper,
sandal-bearer, perfumer, and the keeper
of his jewels.</p>

<p>Thus, one stalwart Ethiopian, having finished
rubbing his handsome frame with aromatic oils,
another slipped about him the tunic and over-dress
of the day. And what to an ordinary
mortal constituted a tight tunic, appeared to
Benkhu, the Prince’s body-servant, positively
loose and ill-fitting.</p>

<p>And since Menna affected extremes, his tunic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
fitted far more closely, his voluminous and
richly plaited over-dress swung out in far more
ample folds, than those of any other of the foppish
members of the Theban Court.</p>

<p>Indeed, Menna left Benkhu’s nimble fingers
dressed as few others of the courtiers could be
dressed.</p>

<p>His costuming completed, Menna listened to
the reports of his farm overseers, and to those
of his spies both of court, bazaar and temple.
For Menna, though outwardly faithful to Aton,
still continued to hold the honorific post of
Scribe of the Estates of Amen.</p>

<p>His business attended to, Menna essayed a
game of draughts with one of his friends, or
rowed about the lake in Thi’s pleasure-barge. It
was the policy of Menna never to be far from
Thi, the Queen-Mother.</p>

<p>When Renny, the Syrian, had been enrolled
among the retainers of Menna, the Overseer
had affected to see much of him. He went to the
length of separating Renny from Beq and the
native Egyptian craftsmen attached to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
house. He even provided Renny with a studio
to himself.</p>

<p>To this workshop Menna himself would come
at times, ostensibly to seek instruction in modeling,
sculpture and wood-carving. As a matter
of fact his visits were prompted by the desire to
use Renny and <em>his</em> art as in former times he had
that of Beq and the native craftsmen.</p>

<p>Renny fell in with this whim of his powerful
patron. Many a minor ornament, such as a
small lotus bowl, incense-spoon or sacred image,
had Renny produced, without neglecting to leave
some slight detail for the handsome Overseer to
finish. Renny’s artistic productions Menna incontinently
made his own, adding <em>his</em> name and
titles together with the date of its completion.</p>

<p>Coming from the hand of such a critical
student of the arts, these small, but ever choice
mementoes were eagerly sought at Court. No
one doubted but that they were the work of the
gifted Overseer himself.</p>

<p>Of late gifts and mementoes of this sort had
suddenly ceased to materialize, and Menna,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
taxed with laziness by his friends at Court,
gave it to be understood that a far more important
undertaking now engaged his time.
But the true reason of the present inaction of
the Overseer was due to Renny, the Syrian.</p>

<p>That unhappy youth, in his constant visits to
the Palace to deliver his masters’ gifts and
notes to Sesen, had seen all too much of the
beautiful Princess.</p>

<p>Yet, a single visit, and that his first, had
proved more than enough to cause the beauty-loving
Renny to come beneath the spell of
Sesen’s haunting loveliness.</p>

<p>Do what he would to conceal his senseless
passion, Renny felt that the fire at his heart
would mount to his eyes, the surging blood, that
seemed ever about to burst his heart, would
flame into his cheeks.</p>

<p>At one moment Renny soared into the highest
heavens; the next found him plunged into the
gloomiest despair. He, an unknown sculptor, a
despised foreigner, dared to lift his eyes to an
exalted lady of the Egyptian Court!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>Knowing too well the hopelessness of his
present position, Renny sought to hide his passion.</p>

<p>Unluckily for the distracted sculptor, his
burning hand had come in contact with the
tapering fingers of the Princess.</p>

<p>Straightway Renny had thrown himself upon
his knees and poured out to her startled ears
the torrent of passionate words which had so
long trembled upon his lips. Renny lost his
head; his discretion vanished to the four winds
of Heaven.</p>

<p>Sesen gazed down at the bowed head of the
young sculptor in utter bewilderment. She
could not have said whether she was more surprised,
angered or amused. She clapped her
hands twice; she would hand him to the guards.
Yet, as the archers appeared from behind the
columns of the courtyard, she changed her mind.
A sudden wave of tenderest sympathy for
Bhanar swept over the Princess. So it was not
Bhanar he had sought so eagerly. Her heart
ached for the quiet little maid standing so still
and mute behind her. She turned to Bhanar:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>“So this is that Renny, the Incomparable, of
whom thou hast so often spoken, my Bhanar!
Dare men so address a Princess of the Blood in
thine own country and live? Like master, like
man!”</p>

<p>Renny leaped to his feet, his face aflame with
various emotions, amongst which wounded
pride, perhaps was not the least.</p>

<p>“Lady! Since when is it considered a deed
ill-done that a man should speak the love and
reverence which he bears a maid? The mirror
in thy hand should tell thee that few could look
upon a face so fair, a form that Hathor’s self
must envy, and not be stricken with that malady
which not even the King’s physician hath power
to cure! That I love thee I cannot help. My
heart beats to thoughts of thee; thy image is
stamped upon my very eyes!</p>

<p>“As to my master, the Lord Menna, I serve
the Prince from gratitude. He found me well
nigh starving in the streets of Thinis and gave
me food and shelter. All my work he purchased
and put me in the place of Beq, a sculptor whose
work is excellent, according to your Egyptian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
standard. His portrait of thee I myself have
much admired.</p>

<p>“Yet, Most Beautiful, ’tis not thee! ’Twould
answer as well for any Lady of the Court. Were
<em>I</em> to model thee, Fragrance of the Gods, thou
shouldst see a living, breathing ‘double’ of
thyself, thy very <i>ka</i> in stone. This I could
prove to thee as could no other.”</p>

<p>During this conversation Bhanar had continued
to ply the ostrich-feather fan above her
mistress’s head. Anguish for Renny, pity for
herself, showed in her beautiful eyes.</p>

<p>Sesen’s heart bled for her. Sesen knew
Bhanar’s history well. Bhanar never tired of
talking about her beloved village, of her dear
Rippa, nestled among the distant Syrian hills.</p>

<p>The little Princess had soon perceived that
Bhanar’s girlish love for her childhood’s companion
had ripened into something stronger.</p>

<p>She had soon noticed how artfully Bhanar
managed to forestall Sesen’s other maids whenever
Renny’s name was announced by the usher.</p>

<p>Renny’s joy and relief at finding her in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
household of the Princess had been genuine,
since for a time, he had felt that he and Yakab
had failed her. Thereafter, at each and every
visit to the Palace, he had quite naturally sought
his beautiful countrywoman. He knew that
through her he would the more readily reach
the lady of his master’s infatuation.</p>

<p>Renny had strict orders to deliver his master’s
notes into the hand of Sesen in person.
This at first he could never have accomplished,
had it not been for Bhanar’s assistance.</p>

<p>This insistence of Renny to reach her through
Bhanar alone Sesen had misinterpreted.</p>

<p>Then came that fatal day when Bhanar listened
to Renny as he poured out his tale of love
for her mistress. Bhanar’s heart seemed to
stop its beating. From that moment she realized
that she loved Renny with all the love that
he—that he, alas, felt for Sesen, her mistress.</p>

<p>At this moment an agonizing sympathy for
Renny seemed to freeze her heart. She knew
that Renny at best did but provide distraction
for the Princess. And now, in this statue of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
which he talked, Renny held out still further
hopes of diversion. From her frequent visits to
Enana’s villa, Bhanar knew that the absent
Ramses was ever in Sesen’s mind, though never
once had the little maid referred to him. In
vain had she confided her knowledge of the
mutual love of Sesen and Ramses to the unheeding
Renny.</p>

<p>Sesen turned from the sculptor as if to leave.
At the threshold of the steps she paused for a
moment:</p>

<p>“Syrian, if you can indeed model such a portrait
as that of which you speak, gladly will I
purchase it of thee, and with it thy freedom.”</p>

<p>The overjoyed Renny kissed the hand she
gave him:</p>

<p>“Within the month, Most Beauteous One!
Give me but four short weeks and thou shalt see
thyself as no one within the confines of the four
iron pillars could ever hope to model thee. As
to payment, I seek it not. Freedom might lead
me away from thee!”</p>

<p>Renny again passionately kissed the jeweled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
fingers of the little Princess and dashed from
the Court. How he finally managed to reach his
studio door, he never knew.</p>

<p>Alas, for Renny and his promise. Even as he
left the outer corridor, Bar, chief of his master’s
spies, glided noiselessly from behind one of the
great painted columns nearby.</p>

<p>Thereafter, Menna the Overseer saw to it
that Renny sped upon no more missions to the
Palace. On the contrary he was sternly warned
to keep within his master’s villa-garden, and the
little workshop which had been provided for
him.</p>

<p>Yet, as luck would have it, in order to keep
him busily occupied, Menna commanded him to
model a statue of Hathor, Goddess of Beauty.
This statue, when completed, Menna intended to
present to the late Pharaoh’s shrine at Amada
to the south. But to Renny he omitted to mention
that <em>his</em> name and his alone would appear
upon its ivory pedestal!</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV<br />
<span class="smcap smaller">A Statue of Hathor, Goddess of Love</span></h2>

<p class="dropcap">Menna the Overseer had little conception
of the torture he had inflicted upon the
mind of the youthful Renny when he
forbade him his liberty. Hollow-cheeked and
well nigh mad, Renny so far disobeyed his
patron’s orders that he sat for hours, nay, for
days at a time, huddled like a beggar at the
Palace gate.</p>

<p>Not even the gentle Bhanar could console him
whenever, as so frequently happened, a day
went by without its being possible for the distracted
youth to catch a glimpse of his idol.</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, he remembered his promise
to the Princess. He sought out Khnum, the
royal quarryman, who had but now moored to
the western bank with a cargo consisting in the
main of the precious alabaster of Hatnub. He
bribed Khnum to procure him a giant block of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
purest alabaster, a mass of the creamiest material
which the alabaster quarries could provide.</p>

<p>For days did master-quarryman Khnum seek
a block of the unusual proportions demanded by
the impatient sculptor. A week went by, an
eternity to the tortured artist.</p>

<p>Finally, just as he was about to despatch a
second expedition northward, and during the
heat of one of the first days of the great sandstorm,
Khnum and his sweating assistants
hauled a wooden sledge before his dust-covered
threshold. And there, high upon the friction-charred
vehicle, stood the glossiest block of
Hatnub’s finest alabaster which the distracted
Renny had ever seen.</p>

<p>For many years men spoke of that never-to-be-forgotten
sandstorm, a storm which ushered
in days of blinding heat, days in which the flints
that strewed the desert plateau cracked beneath
the excoriating heat; days in which the ocher-hued
river banks, confining a blinding reach of
sluggish water, the shriveled and blasted sycamore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
tamarisks and palms, nay, the very capital
itself, seemed to be confined within the sun-god’s
fiery furnace.</p>

<p>Day in, day out, those death-dealing rays shot
from a changeless vault of steely blue. Down
sank the tortured cattle; the birds gasped
among the shriveled leaves of the trees. The
very soil, by now as hard as any southern granite,
yawned with wide-thrown crevices many
cubits deep. Far to the south the broad-winged
vultures circled slowly earthward from their
lofty posts, as if they too feared the darts of the
outraged Amen.</p>

<p>It was a sudden and appalling visitation
which luckily blew itself out within but four of
the customary nine days of blinding wind and
sand.</p>

<p>Yet, throughout those four memorable days
and thereafter Renny worked as he had never
worked before.</p>

<p>Now, there came a day when Menna ordered
his carrying-chair and bade his bearers set him
down before the door of Renny’s workshop.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>At the Overseer’s repeated knocks the bolts
were slowly drawn. Through the barely opened
door Renny, blinded by the glare, gazed unseeingly
toward the extended hand of his smiling
patron:</p>

<p>“How now, Syrian? Hast turned magician?
Bar tells me thou must needs have conned the
<i>hekau</i>-spell that bringeth food and drink, since
all the food that is brought thee stands untasted.
Breath of the Goddess! Why hast sulked behind
barred doors these weeks and more?”
Menna made as if to step within.</p>

<p>“Ah, master, most noble lord, I do beseech
thee, go not within! Bethink thee, Splendor of
Thebes, when first I came to thee, thou didst
assure to me that privacy which, far more than
thy golden <i>uten</i>, I did ask of thee! Continue
now thy favor some little time, I pray. Thy
statue of the Goddess Hathor is...!”</p>

<p>“Amemet eat me! Days, nay weeks, have we
waited for a sight of it! Now is our sore-tried
patience at an end.”</p>

<p>With a firmness unexpected in the customarily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
indolent Menna, the Overseer pushed
the trembling Renny aside and entered the
workshop.</p>

<p>At first, so sudden was the change from the
glare of noonday to the murky shadows of the
room, that Menna could distinguish nothing.
When at last his eyes grew somewhat accustomed
to the gloom, he found himself staring
at the tinted statue of a regally robed woman,
a life-sized figure so startlingly realistic that for
a moment he instinctively drew back.</p>

<p>Upon a pedestal festooned with drooping
lotus and fragrant mimosa stood the smiling
figure of the Princess Sesen. So lifelike did the
statue appear to the bewildered noble, that for
a space of a full minute, he waited, expecting
her lips to part, her tongue to utter the customary
greetings.</p>

<p>Once his jeweled fingers had assured him that
the figure was but tinted stone, Menna burst into
voluble exclamations of wonder and delight.</p>

<p>“Verily, said I not that thou hadst learned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
some potent charm, some mighty <i>hekau</i>, known
but to the blessed gods alone?</p>

<p>“Breath of Hathor! ’Tis the work of Ptah,
nay, of Khnum himself, Fashioner of Mankind!
None but a god could thus turn stone to flesh,
put breath in the nostrils, life in the eye!</p>

<p>“Ah Syrian! if this be Syrian art, my heated
arguments were but wasted breath! Compared
to our Egyptian figures, shackled, mummified,
as lifeless as the granite they are carved in, here
stands grace and freedom, life itself!</p>

<p>“By the Theban Triad, the very blind would
know this figure for the Princess, the Lady
Sesen...!”</p>

<p>Menna broke off abruptly. Sesen?</p>

<p>Suddenly Menna’s face flamed in anger.
Could there indeed be something between the
Princess and this slave, this nobody?</p>

<p>Nay, as far as the Princess was concerned,
Menna felt sure that Bar’s reports of Renny’s
heedless temerity were false. At the moment
Menna felt sure that he had good cause to trust<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
the Princess. He fingered a scented note tucked
in his jeweled belt.</p>

<p>But Renny...?</p>

<p>Menna shook his perfumed wig, and turning,
spoke the young man’s name. Thrice he called,
then strode to the half opened door.</p>

<p>Renny had vanished.</p>

<p>With a threatening imprecation the irate
Overseer turned once more to the statue.</p>

<p>Yes, here was Hathor, Goddess of Beauty,
Goddess of Love, as none in Egypt had ever conceived
her!</p>

<p>Menna’s brain worked fast. The statue he
vowed to make his own. Bar and his minions
were despatched to do away with Renny!</p>

<p>What a sensation would this work produce at
Court, and especially upon the mind of the art-loving
Pharaoh! Menna allowed himself
visions of a naturalistic school modeled upon
the Syrian, an essentially realistic school which
should utterly banish the hieratic canons imposed
upon the Egyptian craftsmen by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
dictates of precedent and the will of an all-powerful
priesthood.</p>

<p>Meantime, thought the Overseer, the statue
must be kept from sight, at least, until Renny
was safely out of the way.</p>

<p>He sent off a chairman to bring clay, string
and his signet ring. With his own hands he
covered the statue with the quarryman’s mats
which still clustered in one corner of the little
chamber.</p>

<p>In less time than it takes to tell it the tinted
figure of the little Princess disappeared from
sight. Menna closed the door and, slipping to
the bronze bolt, bound it with cord and set his
scarab-seal upon a clay pellet which he fastened
thereto. This done, he hurried home. To-day
was a momentous day with Menna, Overseer of
the King’s Estates.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI<br />
<span class="smcap smaller">The Curse of Huy, Great High Priest of Amen</span></h2>

<p class="dropcap">What Belur the Hittite Ambassador had
said, concerning the expected outbreak
of a religious war throughout Egypt,
was true. Moreover, no one was greatly surprised
at his report of the disaffection of
Egypt’s Asiatic vassals.</p>

<p>In his efforts to establish the cult of the Syrian
sun-god, in place of that of the various
Egyptian deities, Pharaoh had little time to attend
to the exacting affairs of his country’s vast
empire abroad.</p>

<p>However, Belur’s words cannot have taken
him altogether by surprise, since runners had
brought letters daily from the few faithful
vassal-kings along his Syrian border, letters
begging help from Egypt.</p>

<p>Indeed, of late, these hints of troubles to come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
had resolved themselves into the most urgent
appeals for troops to assist in stemming the
advance of the dreaded Hittites. Two messengers
had Noferhotep sent from the frontier on
a like errand. After a protracted delay Pharaoh
had despatched one division of Ethiopian troops
to his support.</p>

<p>Yet, not until this moment, when a swift cedar
boat was carrying Belur and his suite northward,
did Pharaoh appreciate to the full the
significance of those despairing cries for aid.
As he now saw it, Belur had come as spokesman
for a combined array of Egypt’s Asiatic
foes, the very mention of whose names froze
the blood in Pharaoh’s veins.</p>

<p>Thereafter Pharaoh’s spies were very active,
along the border.</p>

<p>Time went by, yet nothing happened. Perhaps
the boastful words of the Hittite were but
intended to intimidate him. Or could it have
been that the bold front which he had assumed
had in turn deceived the Hittite?</p>

<p>Hearing nothing further of Rimur of Charchemish,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
or of the kings of Kadesh and
Megiddo, Pharaoh again took up the work so
near his heart. All his best efforts were now
centered upon the establishment of the Syrian
solar-cult throughout Egypt.</p>

<p>To this drastic move Pharaoh was incited by
Yakab and by his mother, Thi, not so much on
account of any real love they had for Aton, the
Syrian deity, but mainly as a means of ridding
themselves of the obstructive influence of Huy,
Enana and the powerful priesthood of Amen
in Karnak.</p>

<p>Realizing that the vast buildings of Amen’s
temples in Karnak could never be moved, Thi
pointed out to Pharaoh how comparatively easy
it would be for him to forsake Thebes and the
Palace of Amenhotep, his father, and to erect a
new palace, a new city, elsewhere.</p>

<p>To this end Thi had urged Pharaoh to abandon
Thebes and had prevailed upon him to erect
a new capital, the City of the Sun, far to the
north.</p>

<p>It was to raise this new capital, together with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
all the houses and villas surrounding it, that
thousands of captive slaves were now put to
work deep within the quarries of Hatnub, quarries
famed alike on account of the superb
quality of their fine white limestone and the
translucency of their striated alabasters.</p>

<p>In building Pharaoh’s new city gigantic
blocks in both of these rich materials were
brought down from the hills along a specially
leveled causeway. Each giant block had been
secured upon great wooden sleds of hardened
sycamore, and hauled to the new site by the concerted
efforts of sweating oxen and groaning
sleds.</p>

<p>Overseers were told of to prod the oxen;
others to lash the scarred backs of the unhappy
Asiatic slaves. The chief of each section occupied
himself in pouring water upon the ground
to prevent the sled from taking fire by friction,
or oil to facilitate the movement of the sled.</p>

<p>When not so engaged the chief sang a love-song
in time to the thwack of the overseers’
staves, as they further lacerated the bloody<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
backs of the staggering captives. It was commonly
said of a chief of a quarry-gang that he
needed but <em>three</em> canopic jars at <em>his</em> entombment,
since he lacked—a heart.</p>

<p>At the site of the new city other dull-eyed
Asiatics, similarly flogged into line, worked
waist-deep in sandy pits or muddy ditches. Day
in, day out, the heavy wooden brick-carriers bit
into the cracked and blistered shoulders of
emasculated Amu.</p>

<p>Indeed, long before the quickening rays of
Aton had mounted above the low hills which
shut in the City of the Sun to the east, sweat,
mud and blood had baked upon the naked backs
of Ethiopian, Libyan, Canaanite and Kheftiu
alike. Nay, Egyptians themselves, the down-trodden
herdsmen, were as like as not torn from
their ripening fields to toil perhaps at pressing
bricks for Pharaoh’s palace, library and villa,
or, cursed, cuffed and beaten by the shrieking
taskmasters, to crack their thews at the well-nigh
smoking ropes which encircle some colossal
shaft, shrine or statue intended for the great
temple of the sun-god Aton.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>From their lofty posts above the valley
watchful vultures craned their necks, as they
slowly circled earthward. Such a stupendous
undertaking exacted a heavy toll of death.</p>

<p>But what of deserted Thebes, of Huy and the
priests of Amen?</p>

<p>Ever since the theft of the cultus-statue of the
temple by the Atonites the priests at Karnak
had shut themselves up behind the great walls
of the Temple of Amen. Behind those massive
walls they had continued to intone the ritual of
Amen to an empty shrine and the Theban
Recention of the Book of the Dead to deserted
courts and forgotten offering-tables. Aton and
its ritual they anathematized, though an Aton
shrine had, for a time, been forced upon them.</p>

<p>In their present extremity Huy, the great
High Priest of Amen, relied for support upon
the people, as did indeed his brother hierophants
of Memphis, Thinis and Abydos.</p>

<p>Yet, no help came from the priests of Ptah,
of Atum, of Osiris. The starving and plague-stricken
peasants in whom they trusted failed
to assist them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>For their part the peasants well knew that no
matter which of the opposing factions gained
the upper hand, <em>their</em> present state of utter
wretchedness would remain unchanged.</p>

<p>What cared they for Amen, Ptah or Aton,
when the Nile-god failed them, when Hapi
neglected to pour his life-giving waters over
their parched and stricken fields!</p>

<p>What was Amen or Aton to them, as they
watched their ashen, granite-hard soil crack
beneath the pitiless shafts of a ruthless sun-god!
’Twas an ill time to pray to him under
any one of his three hundred names.</p>

<p>And so it happened that, at Pharaoh’s command,
an Atonite force attacked the battlemented
walls of Amen’s temple in Karnak.</p>

<p>As a result, the ancient temple of Sesostris
was utterly destroyed. Oldest of all the temples
within the encircling walls, its cedar columns,
its silver floors, its walls of gold inlaid with
malachite and lazuli, together with its hundreds
of gold and silver statues of the kings of old,
all were lost in a conflagration started by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
overturning of a colossal incense-bowl which
stood in front of the shadow of the god Min,
outlined in silver in the panels of the sanctuary
door.</p>

<p>That night Huy, great High Priest of Amen,
lay dead, the poisoned cup clenched in his hand.</p>

<p>Yet, before he went forth upon his last long
journey across the rocky heights of Duat and
the demon-haunted valleys of the Underworld,
Huy had arrayed himself in full regalia and
taken his stand before the yellow curtain which
screened the now empty shrine of the great god
Amen.</p>

<p>Aloud he cried, “O Ancient One, Primordial
God! By the power of thy Hidden Name, by
the Heads of the Demigods that surround thee,
hear the prayer of Huy, thy servant!</p>

<p>“Grant that the line of Ahmes be broken!
Grant that no child of Pharaoh sit upon thy
golden throne!</p>

<p>“Let Pharaoh’s name be blotted from remembrance!
Let Pharaoh’s <i>ka</i> be forced to wander
among the dunghills of forgotten cities!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>Slowly Huy raised the poisoned cup: “And
now, O nameless One, before I go forth upon
the way of trial, a token that thou dost grant
my prayer. Give me a sign, O Holy One, a sign,
O Amen, Lord of Lords!”</p>

<p>As if in answer to the High Priest’s cry,
there came a sound as of the shaking of distant
sistra and silver cymbals. There followed the
thrumming of many harps and the sound of reed
pipes. Suddenly, through the yellow curtain,
there was seen a light which slowly increased in
brightness.</p>

<p>In terror the awe-struck priests surrounding
Huy hid their eyes. When again they dared to
open them, they saw that the great curtain had
been rent in two and, below it, stretched at full
length, lay the white-robed figure of Huy, their
leader.</p>

<p>In sorrow, Antefy, his successor, commanded
his bearers to carry him to the chariot of Mei,
the Atonite, where seven and seventy times
seven at the feet of Pharaoh’s victorious representative,
in words at least, he fell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>The other disheartened ministers of Amen
nominally embraced the Aton creed then and
there, or, with Antefy, their new leader, retired
to a self-imposed exile among the arid sands of
Nubia far to the south.</p>

<p>The fall of Huy and the priests of Amen,
seeming to prove the strength and determination
of Pharaoh, Memphis, Thinis and Abydos,
and thereafter, nearly every local shrine
throughout Egypt, at once raised altars to Aton,
the Syrian sun-god.</p>

<p>Once again fortune favored the Atonites!</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII<br />
<span class="smcap smaller">Why Menna’s Chairbearer Staked His All</span></h2>

<p class="dropcap">Menna, Overseer of the King’s Estates,
was known to the Court as a hard and
self-seeking man, and this in spite of
his sleekness of skin, his luxurious habits and
his untiring efforts to outshine the other “followers
of the king” both in beauty of person,
knowledge of literature and the arts, indeed, in
all those visible evidences of culture which distinguished
the Egyptian court.</p>

<p>In spite of this outward display and ostentation
Menna, son of Menna, was appreciated at
his full value by courtier, priest and peasant
alike. Well they knew that but a tithe of the
fat revenues which Menna collected for the king
or had formerly collected for the unhappy Huy,
Great High Priest of Amen, went to swell the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
royal “treasuries of gold and silver” or the
“treasure of the god.” As yet, however,
through fear of the Overseer’s “eyes and ears”—spies,
native and foreign—no one had dared
to inform upon him at the Palace.</p>

<p>In spite of all Menna could do to ingratiate
himself with her, the Lady Sesen ever sought to
avoid him. Yet Menna never despaired. His
attentions were pressed upon her, in spite of all
she could do to prevent. Recently the fringed
Asiatic garments of his servants, an affectation
of the much-traveled Prince, were seldom absent
from her sight.</p>

<p>Yet to-day something had happened which
might bring it well within the realms of possibility
that she might break with the persistent
Overseer once and for all.</p>

<p>During the course of one of her visits to the
home of Ramses’ grandparents Enana had confided
to her a secret which appeared to her
astonished ears well-nigh incredible. For from
him she learned the astounding news that Hanit,
her former beloved mistress, Queen Hanit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
whom she had but yesterday it seemed, seen
laid to rest yonder in the Valley of the Tombs,
was alive, alive!</p>

<p>Rendered fairly dumb at once with amazement
and joy, Sesen sat at Enana’s knees as if
fascinated, her cheeks aglow, her eyes dancing
with excitement, her lips parted as if she would
drink in his every word.</p>

<p>This, then, was the reason of Enana’s feverish
restlessness of late. Queen Thi herself,
whom nothing escaped, had remarked it, had
even commented upon it to Sesen.</p>

<p>Naturally, Sesen at the time could give no
adequate explanation of the unusual behavior,
the ill-restrained excitement, which seemed to
agitate the wizened body of the old magician.
And Queen Thi finally set it down as being due
to loss of favor at court.</p>

<p>In fact, Enana had suddenly withdrawn entirely
from all court functions. A faithful adherent
of the great god, Amen of Thebes, and
a brother of Huy, late High Priest of Amen,
Enana could not but see in Thi and Pharaoh the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
murderers of Huy, his brother, and the implacable
foes of Amen whom he loved and
served.</p>

<p>So the shriveled body which Kathi had sworn
was that of Hanit had been another’s. Sesen
recalled that Enana had often remarked the
striking resemblance which existed between the
ex-Queen Hanit and the Lady Meryt.</p>

<p>It was Meryt’s body then which lay in its
rock-hewn tomb back yonder swathed in yards
of milk-white linens, encased in a triple cedar
coffin glowing with gold and gem-incrustations!
It was Meryt’s body which now rested in its
huge granite sarcophagus, deep beneath the
crumbling Western Hills! It was Meryt’s
mummified form upon which she herself had
placed that last sad offering, a chaplet of
flowers, berries and leaves! Hanit, her beloved
mistress, still lived!</p>

<p>Sesen could hardly follow Enana through the
astounding threads of his story. She gathered
that the ruse by which her mistress had been
saved from certain death at Queen Thi’s hands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
had been Enana’s own, though its successful
accomplishment had been due to the faithful
Kathi.</p>

<p>Sesen begged to be allowed to visit Hanit,
but Enana restrained her. He spoke of the
terrible change in the demeanor of the once
gentle and studious Queen. He spoke of her
vindictive hatred of Pharaoh, of Thi and, more
than these perhaps, of Menna, son of Menna,
whom she considered the murderer of the
prince, her son.</p>

<p>Since her escape from the Temple all her
time had been spent in study, and that with but
one end in view. Vengeance upon the trio
whom she had such cause to hate had become
with her an obsession.</p>

<p>It appeared that in the realms of black art
Hanit had become the equal of Enana himself.
Day and night had she pored over the lector’s
rolls of papyrus, until each and every one of
their incantations had become hers. She knew
all the hidden spells of the Conjurers of Amen.
She could part the waters at a word. Her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
ebony wand could cause grass to grow where no
vegetation had lived before. Behead a bird or
animal and, at a word from Hanit, it would
spring to its feet alive and whole. Even the
secrets of the masons and royal architects were
hers. She knew the secret blocks of stone
which, touched by even the weakest hand,
opened or closed many a ponderous granite
door of tomb or shrine.</p>

<p>Yes! She would have vengeance upon Pharaoh,
upon Thi, upon Menna...!</p>

<p>At the mention of Menna’s name Sesen
thoughtfully drew from the folds of her robe a
small roll of papyrus, delicately scented and
inscribed in black and red with another effusive
expression of the Overseer’s undying passion
and his plea for a tryst. Enana read it twice,
then carefully rolled it up and placed it securely
beneath his leather girdle, saying as he
did so:</p>

<p>“Here may be found the bait to lure Prince
Menna to his bitter doom! It reaches Hanit’s
hands this very night! Verily, what said that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
sage of old, Imhotep? ‘Love is the greatest ally
of the gods!’”</p>

<p>Trembling with suppressed excitement the
old magician rose. He placed a caressing hand
upon the head of the little Princess and departed
somewhat abruptly, leaving her to
marvel at the miraculous escape of her former
mistress and to speculate as to the nature of
Hanit’s vengeance upon Menna.</p>

<p>And Menna? Not long after Enana had left
the little Princess the overjoyed Menna felt
that he could, at last, afford to ignore the reports
brought in by Bar and his other spies. Menna
no longer feared the existence of an understanding
between Renny and the little Princess. A
note from Sesen, a note most tenderly inscribed,
rested at the moment between Menna’s thumb
and forefinger. He smiled as he placed the note
to his lips. He inhaled the perfume of myrrh-paste,
where Sesen’s fingers had touched the
smooth papyrus. Sesen the Haughty, Sesen the
Unapproachable, Sesen whom the great Ramses
loved, had yielded to his attentions and passionate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
appeals. It had been a far longer siege than
usually fell to the lot of the Overseer, but, at
last, the usual stream of presents, poems, and
entreaties had done its work. Sesen had agreed
to meet him amidst the ruins near Mentuhotep’s
shrine!</p>

<p>“Mentuhotep’s shrine? That forgotten ruin!
An extraordinary place,” mused the Prince.
For a moment he doubted the missive; a hint
of suspicion clouded the gleam of triumph
which glowed in his eyes.</p>

<p>Somewhat thoughtfully he reread the note.
The next he had stretched his jeweled hand
toward a little bronze mirror which rested upon
an ivory rack at his elbow. It was a small
mirror, its handle a maiden standing with arms
outstretched as if to support the disk above.</p>

<p>But half conscious of what he was doing,
Menna gazed at his handsome features as reflected
in the burnished oval of the mirror.
Slowly his features relaxed. He smiled, and,
laying down the mirror, clapped his hands. He
gave direction to the obsequious Syrian who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
immediately appeared, that Bentu, chief of his
chair-bearers, be sent to him immediately.</p>

<p>Soon after, Bentu left his master’s presence,
his face, wreathed in smiles, his ivory teeth
flashing. Bentu walked on air, he could hardly
refrain from snapping his fingers and dancing
his joy like “the curly-headed ones,” as he
hurried down the quiet corridors. An excursion
such as his master planned for the morrow
customarily ended well for Bentu, chief of the
carriers.</p>

<p>Throughout the long night following, while
Menna tossed upon his ivory-footed couch,
Bentu gambled away his last worldly possessions.</p>

<p>At first Bentu lost three heifers at a throw.
Then seven sheep went to Beq, the sculptor.
Quickly followed the loss of thirty geese, the
two gold <i>uten</i> which encircled his wrist, his
hound Antef, and finally, most prized possession
of all, his bright blue scarab-seal. All
passed to Beq, the sculptor.</p>

<p>But what cared Bentu, the Carrier! In his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
master’s explicit directions as to clothes for
the carriers, as to food and drink, Bentu
scented an assignation. The new hood was to
be put on the carrying-chair. It was a beautiful
hood, made of the finest linen, in stripes of
green and gold. A love affair without a doubt!
There was a woman in it, and women—as Bentu
knew full well—women paid well for messengers
and—carriers!</p>

<p>Bentu curled himself up in a corner of Beq’s
studio and went promptly to sleep. He feared
to go home; his wife might ask questions, and
Bentu was in mortal dread of Sebekmeryt his
Nubian wife.</p>

<span class="smcap smaller">What Happened When Menna, Son of Menna, Went A-wooing</span></h2>

<p class="dropcap">The ruined Shrine of Mentuhotep lay
somewhat to the north of the great sandstone
mortuary-temple of Amenhotep III.</p>

<p>Fronting it stood a dwarf pyramid surrounded
by brightly-painted columned porticos.
Far to the south stretched Queen Thi’s beautiful
“pleasure lake,” which seemed, at this distance,
a veritable bowl of gold rimmed with
emeralds. The glowing walls and avenues of
stately trees which marked Queen Hatshepsut’s
terraced temple, shut it in toward the north.
High above, and seemingly ever in danger of
crashing down upon it, towered the precipitous
and ever crumbling masses of the purple Libyan
Hills.</p>

<p>The way thither led along the Necropolis
Route, a high-banked road which passed immediately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
in front of the obelisks and twin
statues fronting the granite threshold of Amenhotep’s
stupendous mortuary-temple.</p>

<p>At this season of the year the wayfarer might
appreciate the full height of the waters of the
inundation, since their turgid reaches now
swirled about the walls of the Royal Palace to
the south, and lapped the high walls of Amenhotep’s
mortuary temple itself, though the
latter’s massive walls and pylons stood well
back upon the edge of that crescent-shaped
strip of land whose upper reaches had been set
apart by the Thebans from time immemorial,
as their place of burial.</p>

<p>This late afternoon the waters flashed like
streams of fire as the sun sank ever lower, ever
more rapidly it seemed, toward the low blue line
of the southern hills which sheltered Erment,
city of the falcon-headed Wargod.</p>

<p>The arid sand-drifts, which stretched along
the lower slopes of the Theban hills, seemed
composed rather of snow than sand, so brilliant
was the glare, so clear the atmosphere.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p>Most welcome to the eye were the villa-gardens
of the nobles, with their deep green
groves of date palm, sycamore and acacia.
Many resembled little islands that seemed to
float upon the flashing waters.</p>

<p>But neither desert glare nor flashing water
could detain Prince Menna. Within the hour
Atum, the evening sun, would sink below the
southern hills; the cool north breeze would
spring up, as was its custom.</p>

<p>Menna’s chair-bearers had stood before his
villa door an hour ahead of time. Bentu, their
chief, placed his hands upon his heart and
gazed heavenward, simulating the ardent lover.
Another love-affair, without a doubt.</p>

<p>Such missions meant <i>uten</i>, necklaces or
rings; a spree at Hentiu’s at any rate, and
Bentu loved the very sight of a bursting wine-skin!</p>

<p>Bentu’s speculations were interrupted by the
sudden appearance of the doorkeeper. With a
knowing wink at Bentu the latter obsequiously
bowed, as Menna strode through the curtained
door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>Another moment and Menna, Superintendent
of the King’s estates, high above the shoulders
of six stalwart Nubians, was borne swiftly
along the highway which led to the northern
end of the curving Theban Plain.</p>

<p>Taking his cue from the gorgeous costume
scarcely concealed beneath his master’s fringed
and brightly colored Syrian cloak, Bentu
launched into one of Ata’s love-songs. His
grinning comrades punctuated each verse with
a staccato “ha-ha, o-ay!”</p>

<p>Menna sank back against his cushions; he
smiled. It pleased him that this black shadow
of his had divined his mission. Nay, Menna
felt himself so at peace with the world that he
gave command to allow a peasant’s all too-heavily
laden donkey to pass unchallenged, an
unheard of proceeding on the part of a Theban
noble!</p>

<p>Bentu’s hopes rose. Under such circumstances
all things were possible. He might receive
a jeweled necklace, golden bars; a small
farm, perhaps.</p>

<p>Indeed, Bentu’s expectations assumed so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
rosy an aspect, that he broke into a dance,
clapping his hands or snapping his fingers in
time to his leapings and posturings, quite in
the manner of the Nubians, the curly-headed
people to the south.</p>

<p>With the sudden disappearance of the swollen
sun-disk behind the deep blue hills of
Erment, song and dance abruptly ceased.
Menna indicated that he would descend from
his chair, and all, master and men together,
addressed a short prayer for the success of the
Sun-god in his ceaseless conflict with Apep,
Fiend of Darkness.</p>

<p>Piety was a habit with Menna, as with Bentu
and the rest.</p>

<p>This done, once more Menna’s chair swung
along the high embankment. Once again the
warning shouts or blows from the forked staff
of Bentu kept the narrow way free.</p>

<p>Arrived before the tree-set entrance to the
Temple of Thothmes, Menna left his servants
and continued westward, past Amenhotep the
Second’s temple, on foot. Soon his tall figure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
was lost among the groves of cedars, karobs
and acacias with which the tomb precincts of
the nobles Senmut, Ra, and Rekmara, were
thickly planted.</p>

<p>Passing the great monument of the architect
Senmut, from which vantage point the great
cedar which marked the tomb precinct of his
father and mother was visible, Menna turned
towards the yellow terraces of Hatshepsut’s
ivory-columned temple. To the left, he could
already distinguish the little pyramid and the
terraced colonades of the Mentuhotep Shrine,
near which was the spot he sought. A few minutes
more and he had crossed the ruined forecourt
of that ancient king’s memorial shrine.</p>

<p>For a moment Menna looked about him. He
consulted a memorandum which he took from
his jeweled belt. Then again, with an anticipatory
smile, he ascended to the highest terrace
and suddenly vanished into a dark opening
which seemed to lead into the very face of the
stupendous cliffs which towered above.</p>

<p>Menna was soon in total darkness. He felt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
himself descending a long, narrow passage-way
pitched at a very steep incline. He must have
gone some two hundred paces when he felt,
rather than saw the glow of a light. Soon he
could distinguish the polished surface of the
granite slabs with which the narrow walls were
faced.</p>

<p>All was well! The Princess awaited him!</p>

<p>Standing in the opening of the doorway,
Menna softly spoke her name. The Princess
did not answer, but stood well back within the
shadows of an alabaster naos, a shrine which,
centuries before, had held a statue of the deified
king, Mentuhotep. At the right he saw a dark
and narrow doorway in which were visible a
few ascending steps cut in the rock.</p>

<p>The slim figure of the Princess was concealed
beneath a long Memphite cloak. She appeared
not to have heard his greeting.</p>

<p>Again Menna softly called her name:
“Sesen! My Lily, My Lotus! Behold thy
lover, O Daughter of Hathor!”</p>

<p>Still the figure was silent. Smilingly Menna<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
drew near; he understood. With a wealth of
flattering phrases on his lips, he sought to catch
her to him. As he did so, the figure turned, and
revealed to his astounded gaze the burning eyes
of Hanit, of Hanit the former Queen!</p>

<p>Yet, Hanit was dead! He had seen her embalmed
body laid away in her rock-hewn tomb!</p>

<p>With a hoarse and inarticulate cry Menna
turned and fled. ’Twas the visible <i>ka</i> of the
outraged queen, ’twas Hanit’s vindictive
<em>double</em>! Nay, it ’twas Hanit herself, whose
mummified form he himself had seen, what time
Huy, the Great High Priest, had performed the
last rites, with the ceremonial opening of the
eyes, the ears, the mouth! Had not he himself
placed a wreath upon her well-swathed form,
and thereafter seen the coffin lowered in her
rock-hewn tomb?</p>

<p>As Menna stumbled up the steep incline of
the rock-hewn passage, black horror seized
upon him; a paralyzing terror rose from his
throbbing heart and mounted to his numbed
brain. He tore the heavy gold chains and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
jeweled <i>wesekh</i> from his throat. He felt that
he was choking.</p>

<p>“Breath of Ra! The doorway, air, light, the
blessed daylight!”</p>

<p>As Menna groped his way up the passage he
heard in front of him, a dull thud as of some
heavy falling body. For a moment his headlong
flight was arrested. The solid rock beneath
his feet seemed to tremble. He rushed up
the last few yards of the narrow corridor and
came suddenly in violent contact with an immovable
block of polished granite.</p>

<p>A cold perspiration burst out upon his forehead;
his knees trembled beneath him. He was
trapped.</p>

<p>The overseer made a last attempt to think
clearly. For a few moments he succeeded in
stifling the terror that gripped his heart.</p>

<p>Menna carefully felt the walls over and over
again to left, to right, in front! Not a crack
nor a crevice. Always that granite door! In an
agony of fear Menna hurled himself against it.
He shrieked, he raved, he cursed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>Finally the Overseer, no longer human,
turned and crept back along the granite
passage-way. The dust of centuries rose into
his throat and filled his lungs. Its fine, impalpable
particles got into his eyes. The droppings
of innumerable bats covered his robes;
his scented wig had fallen from his head.</p>

<p>Slowly Menna scrambled down the passage,
now in a crouching position, now on all fours.
His blood-red eyes gleamed in the gloomy obscurity
like those of a savage panther of the
south. Blood trickled slowly from his inflamed
nostrils; his lips were drawn far back upon the
gums, as if he snarled.</p>

<p>Menna stood again in the shrine-chamber.
The light still flickered along its granite sides,
upon the ivory-toned naos and the figures and
hieroglyphs with which it was decorated. The
prince gazed wildly about him. Even the ponderous
inner door had now swung into place.</p>

<p>Stretching out his bleeding hands he approached
the huge shrine. He would cast himself
upon the mercy of Hanit’s vengeful spirit,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
for by now Menna was long past fear of <i>bas</i>
or <i>kas</i>, of “<i>ghosts</i>” or “<i>doubles</i>!” He called
her name as, with outstretched hands he shuffled
hesitatingly towards the shrine.</p>

<p>Hanit had vanished!</p>

<p>With a low moan Menna crumpled up and
pitched headlong at the foot of the shrine.
Above his head the light brightened for an instant,
then slowly sank and, suddenly, vanished.
Once again the painted forms of gods and
demons alone reigned supreme amidst the fetid
heat and darkness.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX<br />
<span class="smcap smaller">The Hittites Advance</span></h2>

<p class="dropcap">Pharaoh’s recently completed City of
the Sun stretched at some length along
both sides of the Nile, about sixty miles
north of the ancient city of Siut, sacred to the
Wolf-god.</p>

<p>To-day, fronting its white quay, a fleet of
barges swung idly at anchor. From the high
poop of one, a large temple-barge by its decoration,
Merira, High Priest of Aton, was about to
disembark. At the landward end of its gangplank,
which had been stretched to the well-built
limestone wall of the quay, a knot of white-robed
priests of Aton bowed a fawning welcome
to their portly brother hierophant. Sixteen
stalwart lay-brothers stood expectantly beside
the dignitary’s hooded-chair. Soon, Merira,
High Priest of Aton, high above the gleaming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
heads of his chanting followers, vanished down
the avenue of criosphinxes which led toward the
massive pylons of the imposing Aton Temple.</p>

<p>Parallel with the well-planted gardens and
vineyards of the Temple of the Sun ran the
northern wall of Pharaoh’s new palace. The
southern wall divided it from the gardens which
hedged in the home of the General Mei, a
favorite of Pharaoh. Both the grounds about
the Aton Temple, the palace, villa, and library
of Pharaoh and the house of Mei, ran backward
from the Nile bank to the first rise of the low
hills to the east.</p>

<p>Pharaoh’s gardens, both of villa, library and
palace, were already thickly planted with the
rarest of native trees and vines, but myrrh,
sandalwood, dôm-palm and young Lebanus
cedar from the terraces, might be seen both in
the gardens of the monarch and in those of his
favorites.</p>

<p>At this moment the huge limestone palace
glowed in the heat of midafternoon like a piece
of painted ivory. The sun’s rays turned to fire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
the gold caps of the lofty cedar flag-posts which
towered above the walls.</p>

<p>At the end of a long avenue of young acacias
one could distinguish the archers-of-the-guard,
as they paced to and fro before the palace
gates. A pair of Syrian horses, harnessed to a
light chariot, pawed the sandstone flagging
before the entrance-pylon, or reared high in
air, did the iron-wristed <i>katana</i> show the least
sign of relaxing his grip upon the gilded reins.</p>

<p>Queen Noferith was about to visit the hillset
tomb of one of her daughters, who had died
shortly after the royal family had taken up its
residence in the new city. The royal-nurse,
Thuya, and the three sisters of the dead Princess,
were already well on their way to the
tomb, bearing offerings of food, flowers and
cosmetics for the use of the <i>ka</i>.</p>

<p>Within the interior of the palace, Pharaoh
was busily engaged with that corpulent official,
the chief-scribe, Enei. At the moment Enei
was squatting cross-legged among the reeds
and water-fowl painted upon the stucco floor of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
the room. Upon his kilted knees lay the open
sheet of a long leather-roll already closely
written in red and black with lines of deftly inscribed
hieratic.</p>

<p>Enei held a long reed pen in one hand; two
others stuck out behind his elephantine ears.
He had been occupied all morning transcribing
from Pharaoh’s own lips the “Hymn to Aton,”
which for weeks had engrossed his fanatical
master.</p>

<p>Famine and pestilence at home, revolt in
Nubia, new mutterings of trouble along the
Asiatic frontier, one and all had to give place
now to the completion of this Sun-hymn, and
the ritual of the Aton cult.</p>

<p>The ritual had already been chanted in the
Temple of the Sun. Indeed, it had been intoned
for the first time in a little chapel erected
among the now well-nigh deserted temples of
Amen at Karnak. Here was bitter hearing for
the exiled priest of Amen!</p>

<p>Pharaoh was extremely anxious to hear the
High Priest Merira chant his “Hymn to the
Sun,” a composition which Pharaoh had written<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
for the express use of the Priests of the
Temple of Aton. In order to finish the hymn
Pharaoh had shut himself up in his library
with orders that on no account should he be
disturbed. Ambassadors, envoys, nobles of the
empire, spies and messengers, all must wait
who sought an audience of the engrossed monarch.</p>

<p>But a few moments before, Pentu, Chief
Court Physician, had backed from his master’s
presence, loaded down with chains and bracelets
of gold.</p>

<p>Pentu had gained some real or fancied ascendancy
over Enei the Scribe in a heated
argument as to a probable connection between
the sun-god Ra of Heliopolis, Aton, and Adon,
the Syrian God of Fertility. Pentu’s bald head
glistened like the mirror clasped in the hand
of his waiting daughter. Pentu’s broad smile
widened, if indeed that might be, as his waiting
servants hurled themselves into the dust at
sight of his gleaming decorations, those “gifts
which the king bestows.”</p>

<p>“What stiff campaign hath earned such rich<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
rewards?” asks the travel-worn Rabba, messenger
of Ribaddi, one of Egypt’s vassals in Asia.</p>

<p>“Peace, peace, soldier! Hold thy tongue, fit
but to frighten lousy Sand-dwellers! Hast
thou not heard? Egypt hath done with war!
Corn grows upon our spearshafts, boys swim in
our shields; our curved swords cut wheat and
spelt, our slings kill reed-birds. The ‘gifts of
Majesty’ now reach priests, poets and potters.
Breath of Ra—ahem—Aton, I should have said,
a soldier now must stand aside that shaven-headed
sucklings from the new religious school
may pass! Amemet seize me! Five hours’
waiting is enough for me! Honors to thy son’s
son,” and the officer passes out.</p>

<p>Some three hours later, Ribaddi’s urgent call
for assistance, that small clay tablet upon
whose safe and speedy deliverance into the
hands of the Egyptian king hung the fate of
Syria, Ribaddi’s last despairing cry for help,
still rested in its metal tube about the impatient
Rabba’s neck.</p>

<p>Tired of his long vigil, Rabba had addressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
a few somewhat pointed remarks in the direction
of the painted ceiling, but intended for the
large ears of Seneb the Court Usher. As a not
unnatural sequel, another moment found him
on the wrong side of the palace door.</p>

<p>From the threshold of the courtyard two
giggling pages made the infuriated Rabba mock
bows and salutations in the Syrian manner.</p>

<p>Thereafter, Rabba wandered aimlessly about
and finally disappeared behind the deep red
curtains which blew in and out of Thethi’s
tavern-door.</p>

<p>The following morning, Rabba awoke to find
himself seated upon the edge of a wine-stained
couch. In one hand he clasped a faded spray of
mimosa. He pulled a chaplet of dried and
blackened lotus-flowers from his aching head.
Not a bar remained about his arms, not a
strand of beads flashed upon his massive chest.
Neith, a full-lipped Theban dancer, had them
all!</p>

<p>Rabba’s hand went to his throat hesitatingly,
despairingly. The case that had held his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
master’s message, his credentials and his
master’s seal, all had vanished with that velvet-eyed
traitress.</p>

<p>Ten days ago should the precious letter have
been added to the thousands of clay tablets
which lined the alcoves of Pharaoh’s library
and registry. Ten days ago, Rabba the Messenger
should have been well on his way back
to Gebal, his hillset station, with Pharaoh’s
reply.</p>

<p>Alas! At the moment, Ribaddi’s devoted
city lay a mass of smouldering ruins, in the
midst of which were scattered the ashes of
Ribaddi, Pharaoh’s most loyal vassal, his family,
and those of the entire squadron of Baal,
to which the unhappy Rabba himself belonged.
Feeling that the Egyptian monarch had lulled
himself into a sense of security, the hosts of the
Khabiri and Hittites, headed by Rimur of Charchemish
and the kings of Kadesh and Megiddo,
had suddenly swooped upon the territory of
Pharaoh’s Syrian vassal, Ribaddi the Loyal.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX<br />
<span class="smcap smaller">How Bar and Renny Meet for the Last Time</span></h2>

<p class="dropcap">Reflected in the quiet reaches of the
Nile, a brilliant planet hung, like a silver
ball, in the green and gold of Egypt’s
long-continued afterglow. Below it Aah, the
pale young moon, seemed as if it sought to catch
that scintillating jewel in the hollow of its crescent
cup.</p>

<p>The evening’s stillness was broken at intervals
by the snarls of marauding hyenas, the
barks of jackals and the hooting of the little
golden-brown owls which haunted the over-hanging
eaves of the massive Temple of
Khonsu.</p>

<p>Dusky forms stole stealthily along the narrow
alleys of the half-deserted city of Thebes.
As they hurried past, the paling afterglow reflected
upon the low white walls caused their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
nodding shadows to appear unnaturally enlarged,
menacing, terrifying.</p>

<p>Within Renny’s workshop the more immediate
shadows were at times revealed by the
light from a deep bronze bowl, a brazier filled
with glowing incense-wood. The bowl stood
upon a low stand immediately in front of
Renny’s statue of the Princess Sesen.</p>

<p>Once again relieved of its encircling ropes
and mattings, the beautiful statue of the Princess
stood revealed in all its grace and freedom.
Following Menna’s sudden and mysterious disappearance
Renny had come again to his workshop
to claim the statue which was his. The
little crocodile amulet at his throat had, indeed,
saved him from Bar’s murderous attack. Bar
himself felt this to be a fact.</p>

<p>In the center of the room stood the Princess
herself. Her gaze was fixed upon the statue
with a mingled expression of awe, pride and delight.
At her feet knelt Renny the sculptor,
his upturned face transfigured.</p>

<p>Bhanar, trembling with fear, frequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
opened the door and gazed anxiously, impatiently
it seemed, down the length of the garden
path. As she slipped to the lock the broken
seals tapped softly against the wooden panels.</p>

<p>Why so impatient, Bhanar? Why that gleam
of hatred in those eyes, ever so gentle, ever so
beautiful, as they rest upon the figure of thy
mistress?</p>

<p>To account for Bhanar’s attitude, we must
revert once more to Bar, servant to Menna.
All unwitting of his master’s horrible fate, Bar
had set spies about the Princess. He engaged
a servant attached to the villa to report day by
day the doings of the little Princess, hoping to
surprise her in some unguarded evidence of
affection for the infatuated Renny. He himself
sought and gained the confidence of the jealous
Bhanar.</p>

<p>The beautiful slave-girl, now envenomed by
a sudden jealousy of her mistress, confided to
the sympathetic Bar a note which Renny had
bribed Baquit, the Gate-Keeper, to deliver to
the Princess. Bhanar, after many a vain attempt,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
had managed to abstract it from her
mistress’s ebony jewel-box.</p>

<p>In return for this, the overjoyed Bar had
promised her that this very night should see
Sesen and Renny parted forever.</p>

<p>Thus it happened, that when, towards sun-down,
Sesen commanded Bhanar to get her long
Memphite cloak for an outing in the gardens,
Bhanar trembled with anticipation. She barely
glanced at the ducks, the gazelle’s hearts, the
Delta wine and the lotus-seed bread, which
composed the evening meal. The meal being
over and the low tabourets removed, Prince
Wozer, Sesen’s father, was carried off upon
the shoulders of six chair-bearers in the direction
of the Theban cemetery. It was the anniversary
of the death of a life-long friend and,
as had been his habit, he himself would light the
first torch preparatory to the service held in the
dead man’s honor, he with his own hands would
place the gifts of food and drink upon the
offering-table of the dead noble’s tomb. For
the last five years Prince Wozer had thus acted
the part of <i>ka</i>-servant to Surera the Justified.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>When once the long procession of offering-bearers
which regularly accompanied her
father on such occasions was well on its way,
Sesen and Bhanar descended into the palace
gardens.</p>

<p>Arrived at a little postern gate which connected
with the villa-garden of Thi’s favorite,
the unhappy Menna, the Princess pushed back
the barlock, and both passed through. Another
moment and they had entered the dimly-lit
room of Renny’s former workshop.</p>

<p>All unsuspecting of Bhanar’s treachery,
Sesen had placed the little slave at the door to
watch. Bhanar’s heart beat so violently that it
well-nigh suffocated her. A glimpse of her mistress
reaching out her fingers toward the statue,
her mistress’ other self, struck suddenly a
tardy repentance into the very soul of the
despairing slave-girl.</p>

<p>Suddenly Bhanar started. Three figures had
turned into the narrow garden-path and were
rapidly approaching. In the foremost of the
three Bhanar recognized Bar the Memphite.
Menna’s former spy was speaking in loud tones<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
and violently gesticulating as he hurried the
others up the path. Two archers of Prince
Wozer’s guard strode behind him.</p>

<p>Forgetful of herself, her jealousy and treachery,
Bhanar shrieked aloud; “Renny! My
Renny! Bar is here, Menna’s spy! Fly, while
there is yet time!”</p>

<p>At her first words, Renny leaped to the door.
A glance showed him his old enemy. Who
could have betrayed them?</p>

<p>Hardly knowing what he would do, he drew
the Princess down behind the festooned pedestal,
covering her at the same time with its
heavy wreaths and flowers.</p>

<p>Even as he paused, rapidly scanning the
effect, the outer door was burst violently open
and the giant Bar pushed headlong into the
room.</p>

<p>In the doorway, looming large against the
afterglow, Renny beheld the sturdy forms of
the two archers.</p>

<p>Bar shot a hasty glance at the statue, then
ripped out an oath: “Dog, son of a dog, the
Princess. Where is she?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>With a smile upon his pale face, Renny
slowly raised his hand and pointed to the
statue. Then suddenly as Bar turned, he sprang
straight at the Memphite and struck, alas, in
vain, for his dagger broke short off against
Bar’s hidden leather corslet.</p>

<p>Realizing that his last moment had come,
Renny slowly drew his long Asiatic sleeve
across his bowed head. Motionless, he anticipated
the arrow that trembled between the
thumb and forefinger of one of the guardsmen
who, at his sudden attack upon the Memphite,
had moved up into the room.</p>

<p>The twang of the bow thrummed in his ears,
and, with it, a choking sob and the thud of a
falling body.</p>

<p>Quickly Renny threw aside the light covering
from his face, dreading what his trembling heart
too truly warned him he should see. With a
cry of agony he dropped beside the limp body
of the dead Bhanar. Gently he lifted her head,
scanned her face, breathed her name. In vain!
Too well had Wenamon’s arrow done its work!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
A few red feathers and an inch of reed showed
just above the white robe of his little countrywoman.
The rest of the long shaft was buried
in her breast.</p>

<p>Renny rose slowly to his feet. His gaze
swept the terrified archers to the threshold of
the door. With a roar like that of some southern
panther maddened with its wounds, once
more he hurled himself upon the treacherous
Bar.</p>

<p>His onslaught hurled the dagger from the
nerveless hand of the horror-struck Memphite.
For that worthy stood gazing, as if fascinated,
at the upturned face of the dead Bhanar.</p>

<p>They grappled, tripped and fell, rolling over
and over, now one seeming to gain the mastery,
now the other. Above their writhing forms the
archers awaited their opportunity.</p>

<p>Kneeling at the base of the pedestal the terrified
little Princess alone made outcry, sending
out upon the still evening air shriek upon
shriek, intermingled with peals of frenzied
laughter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>

<p>A slight lessening of the grip and Renny’s
powerful hand stole towards Bar’s jeweled
throat. A snap, a quiver of the big limbs and
the Memphite lay motionless.</p>

<p>Renny staggered like a drunken man to his
feet. Stealthily Wenamon the archer approached,
with somewhat of the caution with
which one might beard a wounded lion in its
den. His bow had been cast aside. A dagger
gleamed in his raised hand.</p>

<p>Renny’s swaying figure lurched heavily
towards the statue of the Princess, to the base
of which the Princess herself still clung. As
his fingers gripped its flower-festooned base,
Wenamon’s dagger flashed.</p>

<p>Renny suddenly straightened himself. His
bloodshot eyes sought those of the Princess,
who stood rooted to the spot.</p>

<p>“Sesen! Sesen,” he cried, and fell dead at her
feet.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI<br />
<span class="smcap smaller">Of the Capture of Belur, the Hittite</span></h2>

<p class="dropcap">The city of Kadesh lay gleaming in the
evening sunlight at the upper end of that
vast plain which stretched northward to
the Lake Country. As viewed from Shabtuna,
where the Egyptian army was now encamped,
it seemed a veritable city of towers.</p>

<p>Along the eastern front of this Asiatic city
the waters of the Orontes glittered like a
straight Hittite sword. The high, machicolated
gate-towers, on the eastern side, were approached
by a causeway and a broad flight of
stone steps. Protected by a white wall on
either side, these steps rose from the very
waters of the turgid Orontes itself.</p>

<p>The city towers were black with people,
frenzied women for the most part. Their piercing
shrieks, now of exultation, now of despair,
floated out upon the flashing waters of the broad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
river. The sounds reached the ears of Ramses,
the Egyptian general, where he stood.</p>

<p>Along the city walls youths and old men
peered anxiously southward, across the level
plain. Men, women and children stood with
faces glued to the openings which capped the
city walls.</p>

<p>The eyes of the people of Kadesh were
riveted upon the ebb and flow of a gigantic conflict,
which had raged throughout the day back
and forth across the broad reaches of the plain
below.</p>

<p>The mighty hosts of the Hittites, led by Rimur
of Charchemish in person, had struggled since
daybreak with the forces of Egypt.</p>

<p>The battle had opened auspiciously for the
Hittites, though the ninth of Khoiak was a
favorable day alike to Egyptian and Hittite.
To the Egyptians it meant that the very gods
would lend their aid in the conflict, for was not
this the day in which the god Thoth gained his
memorable victory over Set!</p>

<p>Yet, so far, matters had gone badly for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
Egyptians. The Division of Sutekh, led by old
Noferhotep, had been surprised at the ford
near Shabtuna, and cut to pieces. Noferhotep
himself had been drowned in the blood-red
waters and his body had not been recovered.</p>

<p>Alas, O Noferhotep, the harpers will not sing
before thy silent form; “the feathered dancers”
will not join thy funeral dance!</p>

<p>It appeared that the spies sent out by the
Egyptians had been deceived as to the numerical
superiority of the Hittite host. An unknown
force of the enemy had been enabled to steal up
on Noferhotep’s infantry as it crossed the ford.</p>

<p>A few wounded stragglers from this unequal
action had managed to reach the main Egyptian
camp, where their distorted accounts of the
recent disaster well-nigh caused a panic. However,
at this juncture the arrival of Yankhamu
with a division of Ethiopian troops, had put
new heart into the Egyptian host.</p>

<p>Thus, then, it had been since daybreak. The
tide of battle had leaned now toward the Hittite,
now toward Egypt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>

<p>The main affray had resolved itself into a
frontal attack, which extended right across the
plain to the very foothills.</p>

<p>The Egyptian chariots had endeavored to cut
around the right flank of the enemy, hoping to
drive them into a swamp which lay to the south-west.</p>

<p>Across the broad plains serried ranks of infantry
pressed to the attack. The reserves of
both armies were now brought into action.
Thus commenced the final stage of the conflict,
a last desperate onslaught which should, once
and for all, decide the fate of one of the two
opposing armies.</p>

<p>The non-combatants high upon the battlemented
walls of Kadesh broke into Wild shouts
of triumph, as the right wing of the Egyptian
army was seen to bend, to break and, finally, to
rush, in wildest disorder, towards a slight curve
in the Orontes river eastward. A mass of the
howling sons of Kheta pressed hard upon its
heels.</p>

<p>The people of the city could contain themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
no longer. For them the battle was as
good as won. The youths flew down to the
great gates which opened as if by magic, and in
another moment hot-footed youth, halting old-age,
women and little children could be seen
spreading in a fan-shaped wave across the
dusty expanse which separated the contending
forces from the city walls.</p>

<p>Suddenly, from behind a low ridge to the
westward, there appeared a long line of two-horse
chariots. In the center, easily recognized
by his bright red leather doublet and gilded
warbonnet, stood the young Egyptian general,
Ramses. A huge Ethiopian <i>katana</i>, leaning
well out over the leather body of the chariot,
urged on Ramses’ horses by word of mouth
and lash of whip. At the right of the chariot
bounded a lean Nubian panther.</p>

<p>The onrushing chariots aligned themselves
upon that of their young and impetuous leader.
With ever quickening pace the long line swept
across the well-nigh deserted right flank,
turned, and hurled a devastating avalanche of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
arrows into the wavering center of the enemy’s
line.</p>

<p>Without pausing an instant the gleaming line
crashed into the very heart of the Hittite army.
Thereafter Charchemish, Kadesh, Megiddo, On,
Thebes and Napata, were mingled in an indescribable
whirl of choking yellow dust, rearing
and screaming horses, yelling and cursing
men, and flashing weapons.</p>

<p>The right flank of the Egyptian army, which
had feinted at retreat, now turned upon its pursuers.
Many they hurled into the river; many
they slew out of hand. The majority, panic-stricken,
took to flight in the direction of the
city.</p>

<p>Scenting disaster, Rimur, King of Charchemish,
fled headlong from the stricken field.
The King of Kadesh hurled his wounded companion,
Belur the Hittite, from his chariot, and
urged his tired horses toward the southern
gate.</p>

<p>Seeing their King take to flight, the forces of
Kadesh broke. One and all followed their royal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
master as fast as chariot, horse or limbs could
carry them.</p>

<p>In a moment the fleeing soldiers had burst
into the densely-massed body composed of their
distracted wives, mothers, grandsires and wailing
children. These likewise attempted now to
turn and again to seek shelter within the city
walls.</p>

<p>There ensued a state of indescribable confusion
in which terror reigned supreme. And
this state of utter panic was not confined to
those unfortunates upon the plain, but communicated
itself to the few people who still remained
within the city. Fearing the fury of the
Egyptian soldiers, these now shut and barred
the ponderous city gates.</p>

<p>There followed such a slaughter of the miserable
sons of Kheta as had not been witnessed
in the Orontes Valley since the day Great
Thothmes had first taken Kadesh by assault.</p>

<p>Fifteen full days was Pahura the Scribe occupied
in listing the spoils of gilded chariots,
jeweled breast-plates, gold and silver temple-vessels,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
and the treasure of Belil, King of
Kadesh.</p>

<p>As to Belil himself, his obese form was ignominiously
pierced by an arrow, as he dangled at
the end of a rope half-way up the city walls.</p>

<p>Once the Ethiopian division had burst in the
city gate, those who had attempted to save their
King, and others who had been driven to the
battlements surrounding the palace, were
hurled over its parapet and met their death
either upon the flagging of the court or in the
waters of the moat which surround it.</p>

<p>Rimur, King of Charchemish, fled night and
day by means of relays. Not a night did he rest
until he found himself once again behind the
giant walls of his capital.</p>

<p>Belur, his brother, badly wounded on the
field, was brought, a pale and sullen captive, to
the chariot of the victorious Ramses. At the
present plight of the once haughty ambassador
to Egypt Ramses allowed the faintest indication
of a sneer to break the stony indifference
of his glance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<p>Following his commands the Prince of Kheta
was led away that his wounds might be attended
to. Belur was reserved for a fate far
worse than death. Indeed, death would come as
a welcome relief to the indignities and tortures
that would presently be meted out to him. He
was destined to swing from the prow of
Ramses’ galley head down, where he would be
lightly fed, yet, were it possible, not allowed to
die, until Pharaoh himself should despatch him.</p>

<p>According to custom, a captive chief must
be presented to the great god Amen of Thebes.
Established precedent required that he be killed
before the temple portals of the god himself.
Whether Aton would scorn such a blood-thirsty
offering, Ramses did not pause to think.</p>

<p>The irruption of the victorious Egyptian
army into Kadesh was followed by wholesale
loot, division of the women among the soldiery,
riotous drunkenness, child-murder and the apportioning
of the manhood of the vanquished
among the temples of Egypt. There followed
the utter obliteration of the conquered city in a
holocaust of fire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>

<p>Within twenty days from the time Pahura
had commenced to list the first golden ewer, the
once famous city of Kadesh with its gilded
towers and blue-glazed walls, its palace ablaze
with lazuli, silver and ivory, and the great temple
to the Sun-god, a veritable treasure-house
of richly colored tiles and bricks, gold, turquoise,
silver, ebony, Lebanus cedar and sweet-smelling
woods from the Incense Country, lay a
mass of smouldering ruins, encircled during the
day by a veritable ring of vultures, throughout
the night by droves of snarling and quarreling
hyenas.</p>

<p>But, by this time, the victorious host of Egypt
was well on its way up the straight highroad
to the frontier, where it was hailed by the acclaiming
vanguard of the overjoyed Egyptian
populace.</p>

<p>At the first Egyptian city, Suan-of-the-North,
it was rumored that the aged Magician Enana,
Ramses’ grandsire, together with two unknown
and mysterious personages, had been seen to
enter Ramses’ tent. Thereafter they accompanied
him.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII<br />
<span class="smcap smaller">The “Double” of Hanit</span></h2>

<p class="dropcap">A feeling, closely akin to panic, had settled
upon the Egyptian Court. Its members,
of whom by far the greater number
were, outwardly at least, firm adherents of
Aton, had now received a second violent shock
to their already perplexed minds.</p>

<p>Following her safe return from one of her
periodic visits to Pharaoh’s new capital to the
north, Thi the Queen-Mother, had suddenly and
most mysteriously vanished.</p>

<p>The Women’s Quarter of the palace was in
an uproar. Consternation and, withal a nameless
dread, was stamped upon the faces of
courtier and servant alike. The remembrance
of Menna’s unaccountable, and still unsolved
disappearance, was still fresh in their minds.</p>

<p>Upon the evening in which the Queen-Mother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
had so suddenly vanished, the Princess Bekit-aton
had left her side for a few moments in
order to warm, with her own hands, a cup of old
Thinite wine. When the little Princess returned
it was to find the Queen-Mother gone.</p>

<p>She chanced to look out of the window and
was astonished to see Queen Thi, in company
with another lady of the court, the Lady
Renenet she thought, about to round the bend
of the road which led to the Temple of Sekhmet.
It was the first time in her experience
that the Queen-Mother had gone out so little
attended.</p>

<p>Bekit-aton returned to the harem. She did
not suspect that anything was amiss until darkness
descended upon the palace. Then and not
until then, according to the rigid court etiquette,
she again entered the Queen-Mother’s
room—upon this occasion accompanied by the
other ladies-in-waiting—in order to assist the
Queen-Mother to the Banquet Hall. Among
the ladies she was surprised to see the Lady
Renenet. Upon inquiry she found that Renenet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
had not left the Women’s Quarters that day.
And it was the same with respect to the other
ladies. Not one had left the Palace walls during
the entire day.</p>

<p>Yet, one lady asserted that she had seen
Queen Thi enter the palace within the hour.
Somewhat relieved by this, the Princess Bekit-aton
sought the Queen-Mother in each and
every room of the Women’s Quarter. Yet this
search, similarly, proved unsuccessful.</p>

<p>Once again she entered the Queen’s robing-room.
She found no sign of disorder. Queen
Thi had apparently left of her own free will.
The mystified little Princess called to her assistance
Queen Noferit and other ladies of the
harem.</p>

<p>Again the rooms were searched. Led by the
Princess the searchers descended into the gardens.
They entered the quarters of the cooks
and butlers. They explored the dark shadows
of the various columned courts and the murkier
gloom of the side aisles, together with their
innumerable storerooms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>

<p>Finally, when panic seized upon them, they
called to their assistance the Steward of the
Palace. At the news Soken’s changed expression
did little to allay their fears. With a gesture
he swept them all back in the direction of
the harem.</p>

<p>In turn the Palace Steward and the other
eunuchs once again carefully searched palace,
court, garden and lakeside. Darkness descended
upon a house filled with grief and consternation
on the part of the women, and deadly fear on
the part of Soken and the other eunuchs of the
palace.</p>

<p>The fate of Prince Menna, Pharaoh’s Overseer,
was still upon the lips of palace-servant,
priest and peasant alike. Menna’s enemies
were many. It might well be that someone
whom Menna had misused or wronged had at
last struck back and that successfully.</p>

<p>But the sudden disappearance of the Queen-Mother
from the midst of her ladies, from a
mighty building guarded within and without,
caused a thrill of horror and a nameless fear to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
run through palace and countryside alike. It
was inexplicable.</p>

<p>The Temple of Sekhmet, the lake, the palace
and the palace-gardens, were searched and researched
again and again. Not a spot was
overlooked. When at last it became necessary
to send the evil tidings to the new capital, the
City of the Sun, Pharaoh himself came hurriedly
back to Thebes.</p>

<p>As, day after day, the searching parties returned
empty-handed, Pharaoh lost patience.
Hundreds were slain. Soken and many of the
palace eunuchs met their death at the
strangler’s hands. Men soon went to the task
of searching for the lost Queen as criminals
already condemned to death.</p>

<p>For a full week the search was renewed.
Fresh men were called up for the task. Finally,
the soldiers of the Divisions of Khonsu, Ptah
and Sutekh were pressed into service. All in
vain.</p>

<p>One remarkable circumstance was discovered,
following the disappearance of the Queen-Mother,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
and that by the Princess Bekit-aton.
The portrait of the Ex-Queen Hanit, which had
been painted on a column in the Audience Hall
of the late Pharaoh, had been carefully and
completely obliterated. This had been done
just prior to or immediately following the
Queen-Mother’s disappearance. Nothing remained,
where once the portrait stood, but six
words written in red in roughly drawn hieratic:
“By the Power of the Book of Thoth.”</p>

<p>No one could explain this desecration of the
former Queen’s portrait. Mention of the magic
Book of Thoth struck terror into every heart,
not excepting that of Pharaoh himself.</p>

<p>Thenceforth Pharaoh’s fanatical zeal in the
interest of Aton, his Syrian sun-cult, slowly
waned and finally ceased. The innumerable
gifts to the many new Aton shrines throughout
Egypt—one had been set up against the very
walls of the Temple of Amen in the Apt—the
gorgeous religious processions, the ceaseless
theological studies and debates, all were suddenly
abandoned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>

<p>With the change Pharaoh himself seemed to
fade. Little nourishment passed his lips.
Within the dim shadows of his private chapel,
hour after hour the hollow-eyed monarch stood
in prayer before the gold and gem-encrusted
statue of Aton, the sun-god. At times the
statue appeared to his distracted mind to mock
him with a smile half-pitying, half-contemptuous!</p>

<p>Verily, the curse of Huy, High Priest of
Amen was upon him! Noferith, his wife, had
borne him no heir, no son to follow him upon
the gold Horus Throne of Egypt! The scepter
must go to others, to that hollow cousin of his,
whom Thi had been wont to call <em>the mirage</em>.</p>

<p>As for old Ay, another distant relative and
possible claimant to the Throne, Pharaoh suspected
that Ay was even now in secret correspondence
with the exiled priests of Amen,
whose influence was again making itself felt,
not alone in Thebes, but as far north as the new
capital, the City of the Sun itself.</p>

<p>To whom then could he turn? Among the
courtiers about him there was not one in whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
he could trust. Not one could help him. Alas,
too late, he bethought him of the exiled Ramses!</p>

<p>In the midst of a rising on the part of his
famine-stricken people in the south, an insurrection
started by the exiled priests of Amen,
Pharaoh took to his ivory couch.</p>

<p>Thereafter few saw him. He held no more
audiences. Dedu, Keeper of the Robes, alone
attended him. Even Pentu, his physician, was
dismissed and shortly after strangled, together
with Mei, Chief of the Military Forces in the
new capital. Mei and Pentu had both been
found in secret correspondence with the priests
of Amen in distant Nubia.</p>

<p>Dedu, Keeper of the Robes, entered his royal
master’s apartment late one morning to find
him sitting bolt upright, his prominent eyes
fixed in a horrified stare upon the curtain which
screened the door. A single word fell from
Pharaoh’s trembling lips as he sank back fainting
in Dedu’s outstretched arms. That single
word the wondering Dedu swore was ...
<em>Hanit!</em></p>

<p>Thereafter, Pharaoh in terror bade his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
guards drive all visitors, petitioners and beggars
from the palace gates. Pharaoh shut himself
up within its brightly painted courts and
allowed things without to take their course.</p>

<p>The silver-embossed doors remained fast
closed. No watchman paced the battlemented
walls and pylons. No plumed Syrian horses
pawed the flagging before the outer gates. The
gay bannerettes no longer rose upon the gold-tipped
poles fronting the main entrance to the
palace forecourt. Hushed were the voices of
the guards and other palace servants. Even
the birds which flitted back and forth among the
trees seemed to have forgotten their cheerful
songs.</p>

<p>Finally, one memorable evening, when the
dying Pharaoh lay propped up high upon his
couch, he beckoned to Prince Antef, Lord of
Thebes, who stood in the center of the awe-struck
group before him.</p>

<p>Dropping the hairless lids of a pair of
vulture-like eyes, eyes filled at the moment with
a joy which the Prince tried in vain to conceal,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
Antef fell upon his knees beside the dying
Pharaoh’s couch. He already felt the gold
diadem of kings about his wig, the royal asps
about his forehead.</p>

<p>Silence descended upon the little room.
Silence seemed to fall upon the entire building,
both within and without. The wails of the
women ceased, the chanting of the priests and
the sobs and cries of the palace servants, all
abruptly stopped.</p>

<p>So long continued was the sudden hush that
the expectant Antef slowly raised his head.</p>

<p>As his questioning eyes met those of his
royal master, Antef there beheld such a look of
terror, a look reflected he saw upon the faces
of the nobles behind the dying monarch, that
the astounded Theban himself felt somewhat of
the chill that seemed to have changed his
master and his friends to stone.</p>

<p>He caught the whispered sound of a once
familiar name. It seemed to be on everyone’s
lips: Hanit! Hanit! Hanit!</p>

<p>Antef turned himself about. At once that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
same nameless terror held him also in its grip.</p>

<p>In the doorway stood Queen Hanit, Hanit
upon whose mummified form he himself had
placed a wreath of flowers! Antef stumbled to
his feet and there remained, his eyes fixed upon
this apparition of the Ex-Queen, as if he likewise
had been turned to stone.</p>

<p>A richly plaited robe covered Queen Hanit’s
form. About her head was set the vulture diadem,
that circlet of gold which queens of the
royal blood alone may wear. Her throat was
hidden by a necklace of bright blue beads.
Upon one finger she wore a blue glazed ring, a
ring such as is worn by the dead alone! Before
her she held a Book which seemed to glow,
as if by some preternatural light.</p>

<p>By now Antef and the horrified nobles had
backed to the furthest corner of the room,
whence they continued to gaze at this apparition
of the former Queen, believing it to be
in very fact the visible “double” of Thi’s murdered
rival.</p>

<p>Hanit’s black eyes glittered like those of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
some poisonous snake. She fixed them threateningly
upon the shrunken features of the terrified
monarch:</p>

<p>“Dost know me, son of Thi?”</p>

<p>The trembling monarch tried in vain to
speak.</p>

<p>“Dost know me, Syrian?”</p>

<p>Again Pharaoh essayed to find his nerveless
tongue. At last, in a hoarse and breathless
whisper, he managed to articulate the one word
... Hanit!</p>

<p>Again the soft and unearthly voice of Hanit
thrilled their ears:</p>

<p>“Son of Thi, thou that art about to wander
forth upon the steep and stony hills of Duat,
hearken unto the utterance of Amen, king of
gods! By the power of this Magic Book, thy
Hidden Names are revealed to me! Known to
me are the Mystic Names of the Genii that protect
thee! By the Power of the Book, thy <i>ka</i>
hath been destroyed! Thy soul is destroyed!</p>

<p>“Awake, awake! Pass not forth until I have
shown thee a marvel, saith Amen, king of gods!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
Stand forth, Son of Amen! Receive the
Scepter of Amen which is thine!”</p>

<p>With this the apparition slowly moved back,
and there before them, arrayed in the full regalia
of kings, the curved sword of Amen
clasped in his hand, stood Ramses, the conqueror
of Rimur and the Hittites.</p>

<p>The seeming “double” of the dead Queen
raised the Luminous Book high above her head:</p>

<p>“Hearken, Egyptians! Hearken to the words
of Amen, king of gods! With this sword
divine hath Ramses, my son, hurled back the
Hittites from your borders! With this sword
divine hath he won a glorious victory! Rimur
grovels in the dust before him; Belur awaits
his bitter doom! Of a truth is this my son, born
of my will, essence of my essence, saith Amen,
king of gods! Salute your king! Salute him,
Electrum of Kings, Essence of a God!”</p>

<p>She ceased, and vanished as abruptly as she
had appeared. In her place stood a figure
arrayed in the regalia of the great god Amen.
In his hand he held the Double Crown of Egypt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span></p>

<p>As if overcome at this manifestation of the
power of the great God Amen, Mei-amen, new
leader of the Prophets of Amen, slowly and
reverently advanced and, falling at Ramses’
knees, kissed the hem of his garment. As he
rose, few noted the look that passed between
them.</p>

<p>Thereafter, the dead Pharaoh was forgotten.
Indeed, as the cries of the palace-women broke
out once more, the assembled nobles burst into
a shout, new to those resplendent walls, a shout
which brought the terrified servants to the
door:</p>

<p>“Hail to thee, Ramses, chosen of Amen!
Life, Satisfaction and Health to Pharaoh, our
lord, forever and ever!”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“Let me see, how do the Egyptians express
it? O, I remember! Now of the coming to the
throne of Ramses, of his marriage to the Princess
Sesen, of the cutting out of the hated name
of Aton from temple, tomb and dwelling, is it
not written in letters of red and black upon a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
leather scroll and stored within the Temple of
Amen in the Apt unto this day!</p>

<p>“You know this to be true, Clem! But do
you know that Seneb, the mason, was sent to cut
out all mention of Menna upon the walls of his
tomb! Menna, son of Menna, never reached the
Blessed fields of Aaru, of that you may be
sure.</p>

<p>“Yes, I know what your next question will
be! The Luminous Book!</p>

<p>“Listen! What I am going to tell you is interesting
and true. I can vouch for the story,
as I had it from the lips of Enana himself.</p>

<p>“Enana placed the Magic Book in a cauldron
of boiling water drawn from the Sacred Lake
by a virgin of the Temple of the Mother-goddess.
Thus the mystic powers with which the
Book had been imbued became incorporated in
the holy water.</p>

<p>“A draught of this enchanted water Queen
Hanit drank and, drinking, died. The remainder,
according to her wish, was sprinkled over
her body, immediately following the placing of
her mummy in the tomb.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>

<p>“Thereafter Enana ‘said that which he said,’
Enana ‘intoned that which he intoned,’ and the
immutable curse of the Conjurers of Amen was
repeated before the door of her tomb:</p>

<p>“‘Behold! As Ra, the Sun-god, liveth!
Whosoever seeketh to desecrate this tomb
dieth! Whosoever toucheth this body to remove
it dieth! On earth death is his portion!
In the underworld annihilation is his destiny!
In the Hidden Name of Amen, king of gods,
this curse remaineth, yea, so long as Ra, the
Sun-god, endureth!’</p>

<p>“You see, Clem! It is not to be wondered at
that those men died so suddenly, or that the
curator, who likewise handled mummy No. 49,
himself succumbed. It proves, without the
shadow of a doubt, that the curse of the Conjurers
of Amen <em>did</em> endure. Sesen can tell
you....”</p>

<p>“Steven, please lie down and stop talking.
Don’t worry about things. Try to compose
yourself.”</p>

<p>As I sank dutifully back upon the pillows, I
was aware of a soft and deliciously cool hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
which gently pressed my throbbing head. A
smiling face bent over me.</p>

<p>My bewildered eyes wandered from a trim
little white cap to a spotless white dress and
shoes, White canvas shoes!</p>

<p>“Where are her pretty gilded sandals?”
thought I.</p>

<p>I tried to speak to her. I even made an effort
to catch the soothing hand at my forehead.</p>

<p>At this the white figure vanished, and in its
place, stood Braintree, the Seaforth’s doctor.</p>

<p>“Great Scott, I have it. I am in the hospital!
That was Susan....”</p>

<p>“That’s just where you are, Steven. And
I must ask you not to excite yourself about it.
Here you are and here you have been for some
time. Tribe, Dunn and I have slaved over you
and won out, at last.</p>

<p>“But who, may I ask, is Menna! No friend
of yours, I’d swear! Susan is equally interested
in some lady friend of your acquaintance,
Sesen I think her name was! Well, never mind
that now. Turn over and rest.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>

<p>Then it was a dream; the vision of a fevered
brain! Enana, Hanit, Sesen, Menna, and
Renny—could I have been Renny—all were
dreams! Hanit! Why such a person never
existed. And Ramses! As yet he wasn’t born!</p>

<p>I tried to smile at the busy little figure in
white. I recognized her now. It was Susan
Braintree, my Susan!</p>

<p>I caught myself repeatedly murmuring:
“Susan the Lily, Sesen the Lotus, one and the
same name, one and the same person perhaps.
Ah, my Beautiful Princess! I can smell the
sweet unguents which Bhanar has sprinkled
upon your dainty Wig, the myrrh upon your
supple hands...!”</p>

<p>Susan presses a little phial to my nostrils. A
few short breaths and—I sleep.</p>
